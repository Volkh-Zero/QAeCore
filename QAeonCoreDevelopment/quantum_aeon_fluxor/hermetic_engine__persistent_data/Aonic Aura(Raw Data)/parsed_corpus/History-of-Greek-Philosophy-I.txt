TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE. 
Tirn present work is a trnnslation of the fonrth and 
last edition of the first part of Dr. Zdler's 'Philo­
sophic dEn' Griechen.' That this part, containing the 
General Introduction to the entire sul~eet and the his­
tory of the eariie5t philosophers, should appear after 
others ueal.ing with the later periods, is in some mea­
sure to be regi·etted, because Greek Philosophy i~ hest 
treated as a whole, and gains immensely by being 
sr,udied in the order of development; yet those who 
are acquainted with the previously translated portion~ 
of Dr. Zeller'"' work will be the more ready to welcome 
the introductory volume, without which, inr1eed, many 
things in the ltiter philosophy, and in Dr. Zeller's treat­
ment of it, would have remained comparative1y obscure. 
'fherc is no need to speak highly of a work so well 
known. The tram;lator has endeavoured to make her 
ver~ion a"s liteul as possible, considering the require­
ments of the English language and its deficiency in 
precife equivalents for German philosophical terms-a

deficiency giving rise to many difficulties which she 
ca1n10t, hope to have always ,mccessfully overcome. 
She desires to express her hearty thanks to Mr. 
EVELYN AnnoTT, Fello,v and Tutor of Balliol College, 
Oxford, for his valuable assistance in reading over t-he 
proof sheets, especially in regard to the Greek note~. 
It is, perhaps, necessary to add, respecting the 
numerous references, that Vol. I. and IT. stand for the 
volumes of the present translation, and Part I. II. and 
ITT. for the divisions of the German work.

AUTHOR'S PREFACE. 
TW.l!l~TY YF,AUS AGO, when l published in it8 later form 
the first volume of this work, originally designed on 
a different plan, and a far morn limited scale, I ex­
plained in the following words the principles which 
had guided me in its composition: 'In the treatment 
of my subject I have constantly kept in view tbe task 
which I proposed to myself in my first 11.pproaches to it; 
viz. to maintain a middle conrse hetwMn erudite en­
quiry and the speculative st,utly of history: neither, on 
the one baud, to co1lcct-facts in a merely f\!npirical 
manner; nor, on the other, to construct ci p-rior'i, theories; 
but through the traditions themselves, by means of cri­
tical sifting and historical combination, to anivc at a 
kno,vledge of their importance and interdependence. 
This task, however, in regard to the pm-Socratic philo­
sophy was rendered peculiarly difficult by the ~haractcr 
of the fiources and the divergencies of modem opinions 
re~pecting them : it was impo~siblc adequately to fulfil 
it without a numb~r of critical discu3sions, often 
dem~ndiug to the minutest details. 'l'hat t11e clearness

of the historical exposition, however, might not be 
thereby impaired~ I have consigned these discmsion~ 
as much as possibl<3 to tbe notes, where also the test.i-· 
. mouies and references respecting the authorities find 
.a fitting· place. But the writings froru which these are 
taken are many, anrl some of them difficult, to obtain, 
~o Lbat il has often been nece~Bary to give the quota­
tions at lrngth to make it possible for the reader to test 
the authenticity of my exposition without an unwarrant­
able expenditmc of time. Thus the amount of notes, 
and consequently the size of the whole volume, have 
increased to a considernble extent ; but I hope I bavc 
chosen right1y in attending before all things to the 
scientific requirements of the reader, and in doubtful 
cases preferring; to economise bis time rather than the 
printer's paper.' 
I have kept to the Rame points of view in the pre~ 
i,aration of the following volumes, and of the new 
editions which have since become neces8ar_y. The hope 
that I have therein adopted the proper course ha~ been 
fully justified by the reception given to my work ; and 
thoug·h the principle (not previously quite unknown to 
me) has recently beer, pre::sed upon my attention, that the 
ancient philosophers must be treated philosophically, 
I have never yet been able to convince myself that the 
method hitherto purrned by me }rns been a mistake. I 
still bold, mo1·e strongly than ever, that the philosopbic 
apprehension of systems of philosophy (whfoh, however, 
must be distinguished from philosophic tYriticism) en-

tirely coincides with the historic apprehension of them, 
I ean never indeed consider that a proper history l1as 
been written if the author has stopped short at the bare 
enumeration of i,;olated doctrines and statement;; without 
enquiring as to their centre of gravity, examining their 
foterconnection, or tracing out their mrnct meaning; 
without determining their relation and importance 
to the various systems collectively. But, on the other 
hand, I m 11st protest against the misuse of the 11oble 
name of philosophy for the purpose of depriving hi8-
torical phenomena of their distinctive character, of 
forcing upon the ancient philosophers inferences which 
they expressly repudiate, of effacing the contradictions 
and supplying the lacunm of tlieir systems with adjuncts 
that arc pur<:: inYentions. The great phenomena of the 
past are much too great in my eyes for rne to suppose 
that I could do them any service by exalting them above 
their historical conditions and limi.tations. In my 
opinion, such a false idealisation makes them smaller 
instead of greater. A~ all events, not.hing can thereby 
be gained for historic trnth, before which every predi­
lection for particular persons and schools must g·ive way. 
Whoever would expound a philosophic system must re­
produce the them·ies held by it~ author in the connection 
which they had in l1is mind. This we can only learn 
from the:, tcstimd.iy of the pbilosopbers tbewsel-ves, and 
from the statements of others concerning their doctrines; 
but, in comparing tbcse testimonies, in examining their 
authenticity and credibility, in completing them by in-

ferences anrl combinations of various kinds, we must be 
careful to remember two things: in tbe first place, the 
inductions which carry us beyond direct testimony must 
in each cru,e he founded on the totality of evidence in 
our possession ; and when a philosophic theory seems to 
us to require certain fur'Lher theories, we must always 
examine whether other portions of the author's system, 
quite as important in his estimation, do not stand in the 
way. Secondly, we m11st enquire whether we are just.i. 
fled in supposing that the philosopher we are considering 
propounded to himself the questions which we are pro­
pounding to him) returned to himself the answers which 
we deriYe from other statements of his, or himself drew 
the inferences which to us appear ~rncessary. To pro­
ceed in this spirit of scientific circumspection has been 
at any rate my own endeavour. To this end, as will be 
seen in tbe later no less than in the earlier editions ofmy 
work, I have also tried to learn from those writers who 
here and there, on points of greater or lesser importance, 
have differed from me. If I am indebted to these writers 
for many things that have assisted in the completion 
and correct.ion of my exposition, it will nevertheless be 
understood that, in all essential points, I could only re­
main true to my own view of the pre-Socratic philo­
sophy, and have uefeucled that view as persistently and 
decidedly as the interest of the subject demanded, 
against objections which seemccl to me unconvincing 
and untenable.

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT. 
INTRODUCTION. 
CHAPTER I. 
ABI, SCOPE AND )fETIIOD m' THE PRESlsNT WORK.. 
Tm, term Philosophy, as in use among the Greeks, 
varied greatly in its meaning and compas:s.1 Originally 
it denoted all mental culture, ,md all effort in the 
direction of culture; 2 even as uo<pta, the word from 
which it is derived, was applied to every art and every 
kind of knowledge.3 A mmc restricted significance 
seem;; first to have been given to it iu the time of the 
SoplristH, when it became usual to seek Ftfter a wider 
know ledge by means of more special and a.deq uate

2 INTROD UGTION. 
instruction than ordinary education and t,hc unmethodi­
cal routine of practical life could of themselves afford.1 
By Philosophy was now understood the study of things 
of the mind, pursued not as n.n acceswry employment 
and matter of amusement, but ei.elusively and as a 
separate vocation. The word 1-.hilosophy, however, was 
not as yet limited to· philosophic science in its present 
aeeeptation, nor even to science in gcneml, for which 
other designations were mueh more in vogue : to philo­
sophise 'i'l'as to study, to devote one,;elf to any theoretic 
aetivity.2 Philosophers in the narrower sense, down to 
the time of Socrates, were mdinarily designated as wise 
men or Sophists,3 and, more precisely, as physicisb.J 
A more definite use of the word is first met with in 
Plato. Plato calls that man a philo;;opher who in his 
speculation and hi;; practice has regnrd to e~seuce, and 
not to appearance; Philosophy, RS he apprehends it, is 
1 Pythngoras indcod, according 
to a woll-kuown anoodute, ha<l pre­
,,iously assumed the name of phi­
losoJJher; but tho story is in th.:, 
ft:r,;t place uncertain ; and in the 
second it keeps the indeterminate 
son,;e of th~ word accol'ding to 
which philosol'hY signified all 
striving a~cr wisdom. 
• The exp:rP.ssion, for ei.ample, 
in Xfnophon (Mem. iv. 2, 23) has 
this fionM>; for the philosophy of 
.Euthydcmns (w:co:rding to seetion

Finally, Aristotle still further limits the sphere of Philo­
sophy, by wholly e-xcluding from it practical activity; 
but lrn fluctuates between a wider and a n;i.rrower 
definition. According to the widerr Philosophy iricludAs 
all scientific knowledge and research ; according to the 
narrower, it is rnstrid.ed to enqnfries conccm1ing the ulti­
mate causes of things, the so-called 'Firnl. Philosophy.' 
Scarcely, however, had this beginning been made 
towards a precise determination of Philo~ophy when 
the attempt was again abandonetl; Philosophy in the 
post-Aristotelian schools b ~omctimes cxr.:lusively de­
fined as the practice of wisdom, the art of happiness, 
the science of life; sometimes it is hardly discriminated 
from the empirical wicnce;;, and $Ometimes l'()Ilfouude<l 
with mere e:rudition. This confusion was promoted, 
not only hy the leamed tendencies of the Peripatetic 
school and of the whole Alcxamhfan period, but also 
and more especially by St.oicism, since Chrysippus had 
included in the circle of his so-called philosophical 
enqnirie8 the arts of grammar, music, &c., while his 
very definition of Philosophy, a.s t.h.c science of things 
divine and human, rnnst ha:re rendered difficult any 
precise limitation of its domain..1 Afte1' this period 
science became mme and more involYeu with mythology 
and theological poetry, to the iw:!'ea~ing disturbance of

4 INTRODUCTION. 
tion of Philosophy soon lost all distinctness. On the 
one hand, the Neo-Platonists regarded Linus and 
Orpheus as the first of philosophers, the Chaldean 
oracles as the primitive sources of the hig·hest wisdom, 
and the sacred rites, a~ceticism and thenrgic superstition 
of their school QS the true philosophy; on the other, the 
Christian theologiam, with equal right, glorified mo­
nastic life as Christi-an phiia~ophy, and gave to the 
various sects of monks, including eveu the Shepherd 
Boo-xot, a name which Plato and Aristotle had reserved 
for the highe~t activity of the human int.e1lect.1 
But it is not. merely the name which is wanting in 
accw·atc limitation and fixity of import. Uncertainty 
of language u~ually implies uncertainty of thought, and 
the present (l{tSG forms TIO exception. If the extent of 
tlie term Philosophy was only gra<lually settled, Phi1o-
. sophy itself only gradually appeared us a specific form 
of intellectual life. If the word tluetuatcs between a 
wider and a narrmver significance, Philosophy similarly 
fluctuates ; being sometime;; rcsfricfod to a definite 
seientific ilphere, and sometimes mingled with alien 
ingredients of various kinds. The pre-Socratic Philo­
sophy developed itself partly in connection with mytho­
logical ideas.· Even for Plato the mythus is a necessity,

and after the period of .Neo-Pythagorei~m, polytheistic 
theology acquires such an influence over Philosophy 
that Philosophy at last becomes merely the interprder 
of theological traditions. With tho Pythagoreans, 
the Sophists, Socrates, the Cynics and the Cyrcnaics, 
scientific speculation was connectRd with practical en­
quirjes, which the:,c philo,,ophers did not tbernsclve8 
discriminate from their »cit!llce. Plato reckon~ moral 
conduct as mneh a part of Philosophy a8 kuowleuge ; 
while after Ari~t.olle, Philosophy w;t;; so increasingly 
rega1·ded from the practical point of view, that it ulti­
mately became identified with moral culture and trne 
religion. Lastly, among the Greeks, the sciences (in

the central point towards which :tll s<:ientific efforts 
con..-erge; it. is, originally1 t.he ,d10lc which includes

cannot let him :rest in any part.ial or iwlated view of

mathematics, all his phy8ical enquiries, deeply as these 
enter into the study of the particubs. It was only in 
the Alexandrian period t1mt the special sciences attained 
t.o inrlependent miltivation. Vile find, howevE'r, among 
the Stoics, as well ·as the Pedpatetics, that philo~ophic 
enquiry was blemfod with, and often hampered l)y, a 
great mass of erudition and empirical observations, In 
the eclecticism of the Roman period, this erudite 
element was still more prominent; and though the 
foundi,r of Neo-Platoni~m confined himself strictly to 
questions ,of pure philo~ophy, his school, ju its reliance 
on the authorities of antiquity, was :1pt to overladc 
its philosophic expositions with a rnperabundancc of 
learning. 
If, then, we are to include in the hisiory of Greek 
Philo~ophy all that was called. Philmmphy by the 
Greeks, or that is brought forward in philosophic ,vrit­
ings, and exclude all that doe~ not expressly bear the 
name, it is evident that the boundaries of our cxposition 
will be in part too naffow, and in part, and fo1· the mo~t 
part, much too wide. If, 011 the other hand, we arc to 
treat of Philosophy in itself, as we find it in Greece, 
wliether called Philosophy or not, the question arise8 
how it is to be recognised and how we arc: to distinguish 
it from wlmt i~ not Philosophy. It is clea1· that such a 
test can only lie in the conception formed of Philosophy. 
This conception, however, dmnges with the philosophic 
standpoint of individuab nud of wh0lc periods; and 
thus it would appear that the sphere of the history of 
Philosophy must constantly change in like manner and 
in the same proportion. The dilemma lies in the

how much he shall include in his exposition or rejecb 
from it. For if philosophic conceptions alter, subjective 
impressions alter yet more, and the only resource that 
would at last remain to us iu this UJJ.certain method­
namely, a reference to learned usage-would not improve 
matters from a scientific point of view. One thing, at 
any rak, follows from these reflections. \Ve rnmt have, 
as the basis of Olli' exposition, as trne and exbaustive a 
theory as we can of the essence of Philosophy. That 
this is not altogether impradicable, and that some 
degree of unanimity is attainable on the subject, t.here 
fo all the more reason to hope, because we are here 
eoncAmed not with the term:;; and consEt,uents of any 
one philosophic system, but with the general and formal 
conception of Philosophy, as it is assumed, tacitly, or 
in express terms, in every system. Different opinions 
arc possible, to some ext<:nt, even here; but this diffi­
culty is common to all walks of knowledge. ,v c can 
only, each one of us according to his ability, seek out 
the truth, and leave what we foul to be corrected, if 
necessary, by advancing science. 
Ho,v Philosophy is to be defined, is therefoi;e a 
question which pl1ilo!<ophic science alone can answer. I

}Hider Pli'ilosophy, fir8t, as a. purely tbeoretic activity; 
that is, an activity w11ich is solely conct\rned with foe 
a8C1wtainment of reality; and from this point of Yiew, 
I exclude from the conception and hidory of Philosophy 
all pnwt.ic;:il or al'Listic efforts as sucl1, irrespective of 
their possible connection with any particular theory of 
the world. I next define Philosophy more precisely as 
science. I see in it not merely thought, b11t thought 
tlmt is methodical, and directed in a con~ciou;; manner 
to the cognition of things in their interdependence. 
By this charaderistfo, I di~tinguish it as well from the 
urncicniific reflection of daily life ,is from the religiom 
and poetical view of the w0rld. La~tly, I find the dis­
tinction between l1hilosopby and othr,r s6ences is this :~ 
that all other sciences aim at the exploration of smne 
specific sphere, whereas l1 hilosophy has in view the 
rnm total of existence as a whole, seeks to know the 
individual in its relation to the whole, and by the laws 
of the whole, and stJ to attain the conclation of all 
knowledge. So far, therefore, as this aim van be shown 
to exist, so far and no farther I should extend the do­
main of the history of Philosophy. That such an aim 
was 110t clearly evident from the beginning, and was at 
first abundantly intermingled with foreign elements, we 
ha,
0
e already seen, nor can we wonder at it; But this 
ueed not prevent our abstracting from the aggregate of 
Greek inLe11eetual lifo all that bears the character of 
Philosophy, and considering it in and for it8elf, in its 
historical manifestation. There is, indeed, some danger, 
in this mode of proLocdurP, of doing violt\nr-e to the 
.actual historical c•011nection; but this clanger we may

escape by allowing full weight to snc11 cmL,;idetation~ as 
the following: the constant jnterminglcrncnt of philo­
sophic with other elements ; the gradual natur0 of the 
development by whieh science won for itself an inde­
pendent existence; the pecHlfrir character of the later 
syucretism; the importance of Philosophy for culture 
in- geneml, and its clcpimdcnce on existing condition~. 
If due account. be t,ilkeu of these circum~tances, if in 
the scvernl systems we are ca.rcful to distinguish what 
fa philosophical from wlmt is merely acceswry, :m<l to 
measure the importance of the individual, in reganl tu 
the development of philo8ophic thought, by the precise 
standard and concept of l'hilosophy, the claims of 
historic completeness and scientific exactitude wi11 Le 
equally satisfied. 
The object of our exposition having been thus 
detennined on one of its sides, and the Philosophy of 
the Greeks clearly distinguished from the phenomena 
akin to it and cormected with it, there remains the 
farther question as to the extent and boundaries of 
Greek Philosophy; whether l'\'e arc to seek it only 
among the mernb1-ors of the Greek race, or in the whole 
field of Hellenic culture; and, in the latter ~ase, how 
the area of that field is to be determined. This is, of 
1;1rnrsA, more or less optional; and i.t would in itself 1,e 
perfectly legitimate either to dose the history of Greek 
science with its passage into the Roman and Oriental 
world, or, mi the other hand, to trace its effects down 
to our own time. It seems, however, nwst natural to 
call Philosophy Greek, so long as thorc is in it a pre­
ponderance of the Hellenic element over the foreign,

:mu ,vhenever that proportion is rever~crl to abandon 
the name. As the former is the case not only with the 
Grteco-Roman PhiloHophy, but also with the Neo­
Platonists and their predecessors; ag even the Jurlaic­
Alexm1drian school is much more closely related to' the 
contemporary Greek Philosophy, and had much more 
influeuce on its development, than any phenomenon of 
the Christian world, I include tbis school in the compass 
of the present exposition. On the other hand, I exclude 
from it the Chrfatian speculation of the first centmies, 
for t,herc ,vc see Hellenic science overpowered by a .. new 
principle in whlch it henceforth lost its specific charact.er. 
The scientifk treatment of this historical material 
must necessarily follow the same laws as the writing of 
history in general. Our taHk fa to ascertain and to 
expound what has ha.ppened; a philosophic construct.ion 
of it., even if thi,; were possible, would not be the affair 
of the historiau. But such a constrm:ticm i,, not 
possible, for two re.arnm. First, because no one will 
ever attain to so exhaustive a conception of humanity, 
and so exact a knowledge of all the comlitions of it,, 
historical development, as to justify bis deducing from 
thence the particulars of its ernpirieal circnmKtances, 
and the changes undergone by t.hese in tinrn ; and ne.x.t, 
because the course of history is not of 8Uch a nature 
that it can be made the object of an a '[J1·iori con­
struction. :For hiRt.ory is eHsentially the product of the

i.n all their particular feature~, can be fully explained 
from the point of view of u prfori necessity. The 
aetions of individuals mre subject to that contingency 
which is the heritage of the finite will and under­
standing; arnl if from the concurrence, the colliHion, 
and the friction of these individmtl actions, 11 regular

the particular in this course, nor cvr.n the whole, is at 
any point absolutdy necesrnry. All i,; necessary in :-o 
far only as it belongs to the general progress, the logical 
fram~work as it were of hi,tory; white as to its chrono­
logical manifestation, all is more or less contingent. So 
closely are the two elements interwoven with eadi 
other that it is impossible, even in our 1·efl.ections, 
wholly to separate them. The necessary accomplishes 
itself by a number of intermedia.ries, ;iny one of which 
might be conceived other than it is; but, at the same 
time, the practised glance can detect the thread of 
historical necessity in notions and actions apparently 
the most fortuitous ; and from the arbitrary conduct of 
men who lived hundreds and thousands of yeara ago, 
circumstances may have arisen which work on us wit.h 
all the strength of sueh a necessity.' The sphere of 
history, therefore, is distinct in its nature from that of 
Philosophy. Philosophy hfts to seek out the essence of 
things, and the geueni.l laws of event~ ; hfatory lms to 
exhibit definite given phenomena of a certain dat.e,

Each of thmc sciences requires the other, but neither 
can be .mpplanted by or substituted for the other ; nor 
in its procedure ca.n the history of Philo,;ophy take the 
same courAe that would be applicable to the formation 
of a philosophic system. To say that t11e historical 
sequence of the philosophic systems is identical ,vith 
the logical sequence of t11e concepts which characterise 
0,em, 1 is to confound two very different things. Logic, 
_...,-ll.s Regel conceived it, has to expound the pure cute­
gories of thought as such J the history of Philo;;;c,phy is 
concerned with the chronological de\'elopment of human 
thought. If the COUJ'Se of the one wern to coincide with 
tht1t of the other, this woul<l pre~uppo~c that logical 
or, more precisdy, ontolvgictd conceptions form Lhe 
essential content of all sys~ms of Philosophy; and that 
these eoneeptions have been attained in the progress 
of history from the same ::;tarting-point, and in the 
snme order as in the 1ogieal construction of pure con­
cepts. But this is not the case. Philosophy is not 
merely Logie or Ontology; its object is, in a general 
sRnsc, the Real. The vnrious pliilosophic ;;ystems show

a scientific view of the world. Thei1· coutent, therefore,

depriving it. of its specific character and merging it 
in the universal. Moreover, while speculative Logie 
begins with the most abstract conceptions, in order 
thence to attain to others more concrete, the historical 
development of philosophic thought start:.; with the 
comideration of the concrete, -first in external nature, 
then in man, and leads only by degrees to logical and 
metaphysical abstractions. The law of development 
also is different in Logic and in History. Logic is 
occupied merely with the internal rdation of concepts, 
irrespective of any chronological relation ; Hi1;tory treat~ 
of the changes effected iu c:murse of time in the notions 
of mankind. Progress, from anterior to posterior con­
cepts, is regulated, 1n the former case, exclusively 
according to logical point~ of view; each conclusion is 
therefore linked to the next t,hat is properly deducible 
from it uy thought. In the latter case, progression 
takes place according to psycholoh>"J.cal motives; each 
philosopher constructs out of the doctrine inherited 
from his predecessors, and each period out of thaL 
handed down to it, by tradition, whatever their own 
apprehension of the doctrine, their modes of thought, 
experiences, knowledge, neccKsitics, and scientific re­
sources enable them to construct; but this may possibly 
be something quite other than what we, from our sfaJ1:5J,....,.. 
point, should. rnmstrnct out of it. Logical consequence 
can only regulate the hi~torical progress of Philosophy 
to the extent that it is remgnfred by the philosop bcVi, and 
the necessity of following it acknowledged; how far that 
is the ~c1,;;e depends on all the circumstances by which

what may be directly or indirectly derived from the earlier 
Philornphy, either by inference or polemic, a decisive in­
fluence is often exercised in this respect by the conditions 
and necessities of practical life~ by :rdigfous interests, and 
by the state of empirical knowledge and general culture. 
It is impossible to regard all syHtcms as rnncly the 
consequeIJces of their immediate predcccssor8, and 110 
system which contributes special tlwughts of its own 
can in its origin rrnd contents be thus restricted. "\Vhat 
is new in tho~e thoughts icrbe~ from new experience;; 
having been made, or new points of ·dew gained for 
such a.s had been prcviolL~ly made ; aspects and elements 
of these v.--hich before were 1UJ.uoticed are now taken 
into account, and some particular moment is invested 
with another meani11g than heretofore. Far, then, from 
assenting to the Hegelian position, we must rntlier 
maintain that no system of Philosophy is so comtituted 
ths:t its principle may be expressed by a purely logical 
conception ; not one has formed itself out of its pre~ 
rleces;;ors simply according to the law of logical progress. 
Any sur-rey of the past will show us how irnpo.;dble it is to 
recognise, even approximately, the order {if the Hegelian 
or any other speculative logic in the order of the philo­
sophic syst.c1mi, unless we make out of them something 
quite different from what they really arc, This attempt 
is, therefore, a failure both in principle and praetice, and 
the truth it contains is only the universal conviction 
that, the development of history is internally governed 
by regular law:;,. 
This conviction, indeed, the history of Philosophy 
ought on no account to renounce ; we need not confine

onrselves to the mere amassing and 1erifo,al testing of 
traditions, or to that unsatisfactol'y prngmatic pro­
cedure which is content to explain pnrticuhtrs severally 
in reference to individual pcr~onalilics, circumstances 
and influences, but attempts no explanation of the 
whole as such. Our exposition must, of course, be 
grotwded upon historical tradition, and all that it treats 
of must either be dire<.:t.ly contained in tradition, or 
derived from it by stridest deduction. But it is iwpos­
sible even to establiBh our fa.cts, so long as we regard 
them merely in an isolated manner. Tradition is not 
itself fact; we shall never succeed in proving its tru~t.­
worthiness, in rnlving its eontrndietio11s, in supplying its 
L:umn:B, if we do not keep in view the connection of 
single fads, the concatenation of causes and effects, the 
place of the indiYidual in the whole. Still less, how­
ever, is it po.o.sihle to understand facts, apart from thiB 
interconnection, or to a.rrive at a k11owledge of their 
essential natmc and historical importance. 'l:Vhere, 
lastly, our exposition is coneerned with scientific sys­
tems, and not merely with opinions and events, there 
the very nature of the subject demands, more urgently 
than in other cases, that the particular shall be studied 
in relation to the aggregate ; and this demand can only 
be satidie.d by the concatenation of ewffy particular 
known to UH through tradition, or deducible from 
tradit,ion, into one grc11t whole. 
The first point of unity is constituted by indi, 
viduals. :Every philosophic opinion is primarily the 
thought of some particular man, and is, therefore, to 
be cxplaiued by his intellectual character and the cir-

cumstances under which it was formed. Our -first task, 
then, will be to unite the opinions of ea.eh philosopher 
into a collcdivc whole, to show the l'Onnection of those 
opiniom ,vith his philosophic character, and to enquire 
into the causes and influences by which they were 
originally conditioned. That is to say, we Dlllht fast 
ascertain the principle of each system, and explain ho.v 
it arose; and then consider how the system was the out­
come of tlic principle : for the principle of a system is 
the thought which most clearly and fundamentally cx­
pre8seR the specific philosophic character of its autbor, 
and forms the focus of union for all his views. Every 
individual thing in a system eannot., of cow·se, be ex­
plained by its principle; aH t11e knowledge ,vhich a 
philosopher po,;;;esses, all the convictions wlJich he forms 
( often long hcfore his scieritific thoughts become 
matured), all the conceptions w}1ich he hns derived 
from urnltifarious experiences, are not brought even by 
himself into connection with his philosophic principle:"; 
accidental influences, arbitnny incidents, errors a.nd 
faults of reasoning are constantly interposing them­
selves, while the gaps in the rccord8 :wd accounts often 
plcvent our pronouncing with eertainty on the original 
eonnection of the variom, constituents of a doctrine. All 
this lies in the nature of things ; but our problem must 
at any rate be kept in view until we have exhausted all 
the means in our power for its Holution. 
The individual, however, with the mode of thought 
peculiar to him, does not stand alone ; others ally them­
selves with him, and he allies himself with others ; 
others come into collision with him, and he comes info

collision with other~ ; schools of philosophy are formed _ 
ha,.,ing with each other rnrious relations of dependence, 
agreement, and contradiction. As the 11istory of Philo­
sophy traces out these relations, the forms with which 
it is concerned divide themselves into larger or smaller 
groups. \Ve perceive that it is only in this cl.efinite 
connection with other,, that the individual became and 
effected that which he did become and effect ; and 
hence arises the necessity of explaining the specific 
character and importl'.lnce of the in<lividual by reference 
to the group ,vhich includes him. But even such an 
explanation as this will not in all rcspP-cts suffice; for 
each individual, besides the characteristics common to 
his c.fas~, pv~scsscs much that is peculiar to himself. 
He not only continues the work of his predec:essors, but 
adds somPthing new t.o it, or che disputes their pTe~ 
snp}losil.ions and conclusions. The more important, 
however, a personality has been, and the farther its 
historical infl11.,nee ha.s extended, the more will its 
individual character, even while opening out new paths, 
disappear and lose itsc1f in the universal and necessary 
con.me of history. For the historical importance of the 
individual depends upon hfo uecomplishing that which 
is required by an universal need ; and so far only as this 
is the case, does his work become part of the general 
pmtRe~sion. T}ie merely iudividuul in man is also the 
transitory; t.hc individual can 011ly work in an abiding 
manner and on a grand scale when he yields himself 
and hi8 personality to the service of the universal, and 
executes with hfa pa.rtieular aeti vi ty a part of tho 
c:ommon work.

18 INTRODUCTION. 
But if this hold good of the relation of individuals 
Ul the spheres to whieh they belong·, is it not equa.lly 
tme uf the relation of these spheres to the greater 
wholes in which they are comprehended? Eaoh nation 
and, generally speaking, each historically coherent por­
tion of mankind, hi1s the measure and direction of ib 
spiritual life traced out for it, partly by the inherent 
specific qualities of its members, and partly by the 
physical and historical condition~ that determine its 
development. No individual, even if he deHires it, can 
,vithdraw himself from. this common character; and he 
who is called to a great sphere of historical action will 
not desire it, for he has no ground for his activity t,-0 
work on except in the whole of which he is a member; 
and from this whole, and thence only, there flows to bim 
by numberless channels, for the most parl. unnoticed, 
the supplies by the free utilization of which his own 
spiritual personality is fanned and maintained. But 
for the same reason all individuals are dependent on the 
past. Each is a. child of his age as well as of his llation, 
and as he will never achieve anything great if he does 
not work in the spirit of his nation, 1 so surely will he fa:il 
unless he stands on the ground of all previous historical 
acquirement. If, therefore, the spiritual store of man­
kind, aH the work of Helf-,wtivc beings, is always subject 
to change, this change is of necessity continuous ; and 
the same law of historical continuity holds good also of 
~ach smaller sphere, so far as its natural development is 
not hindered by external infi uences. In this process of

development each period has the advantage of the cul­
tmc and experience of the pre,·ious periods; the historic 
de\0 clopment of mankind, therefore, ii; upon the whole a 
development towards ever highei· culture-a progression. 
But particular nations, and entire groups of nations, 
may nevertheless be thrown back into lower stages by 
external misfortunes, or their own internal exhamtion ; 
important tracts of human cult.me may long lie fallow ; 
progres~ itself may at first be accomplished in an in­
dircet manner, through the breaking up of some imp0r­
feet form of civilisation. In defining, then, the law 
of historical progress in its applir:ation to particular 
phenomena, ,ve mu~t be careful to explain progress 
merely as the logic::11 development of thoi;c qualities 
and conditions which are originally inherent in the 
charad.er and circumstances of a nation, or field of 
culture. This development in every individual case is 
not necessarily an improvement; there mrty come dis­
tmbances and seasum of del:ay, in which a nation or a 
form of civilisation ceases to exist, and other forms 
work their way forward, perhaps painfully and by long 
and circuitous pfl,t~s, to l:arry on the development of 
history. Here, too, a law is present in the historic 
evolution, inasmuch as its general course is determined 
by the nature of things; but this law is not so simple, 
nor this course so direct, a~ we might have anticipated. 
Moreover, ::is the character and sequence of the historic 
periods are the resttlt of law and not of chance, the 
same may be said of the order and cha:racter of the 
various developments contained in them. Not that

Philosophy. But for each historic whole, or for each of 
its periods of development, a definite course is marked 
out by its own fumlamental ehITTacter, by its extenrnl 
circumstances, hy its place in hi.,tory. That the comse 
thuB pre~crilicd by existing conditions should be a;i­
tually followed, is not more wonderful th:rn the fulfil­
ment of auy other calculation of pmbabilities. For, 
though accidental circumstances often give an impulse 
and a dii-ection to the acti..-ity of individnals, it is 
natural and neee3sary tbat amoug a. great number of

ture, of character, of forms of activity, of external eon­
ditions~sufficient to furnish Tepresentalive8 of all the 
different tendencies possible under the given circmn­

faets, we need only examine the facts thoroughly, and 
draw t,he conclusions to which they themselves contain 
the premises. 
·what we ask, therefore, is but the complete applica­
tion of a. purely hi,;tori(~ method. iN e would have no 
theoretic umstrudion of history, proceeding from theory 
to fact; our history must be built up from below, out 
of the materials that are actua11y given. It stands to 
reasm,, however, tha.t these mate.Fials cannot bt: nmdt: 
nse of in their rough st:tte; we mnst eall in the aid of 
a ~carching historical analy.,is to determine the essence 
and iuternal connectiuu of all the phenomena concerned. 
This conception of our prnhlem will not, I trust, be 
open to the charges raised against the Hegelian constm"­
t.ion of hiHtory. Rightly uuderstuod, it can never lead 
to the distortion of facts, or the sacrifice of the free 
movement of history to :m a.hstrac'L fonnalism, since it 
is upon historical facts and traditiom, and UJJOU these 
alone, that we propose to base 01U' reasoning as to tlic 
relation of pa~t phenomena: only in what has been 
freely produced :,;hall we ;;eek for historical necessity. 
If this he thought impos&ible and paradoxical, we might 
appeal to the univerna.l convict.ion of tbe rule of a. 
Divine Pl'Ovidence-a c011ception which before a.ll things 
implies that the conrne of history is not forL1u.tmi3, hut 
is determined by a higher necessity. In ease, however,

rncm.ure in the primitjve essence of spirit, and in the 
laws of human nature ; and tlmt by virtue of this 
internal subjection to law, even what is really forh1itous 
in the individual act bet:omes necessity in the grand 
course of historic evolution. To follow this course in 
detail is the maiu problem of history. 
Whether in regard to the history of Philosophy it 
is necessary or even advantageom, for the writer to 
possess any philosophic conviction of hi.a: own, is a 
question that would scarcely have been. raised had not 
the dread of a philosophic construction of history 
caused some minds to overlook the most simple and 
obvious truths. Few would midntain that the history 
of faw, for instance, would find its be~t. exponent in a 
pcrsm1 who had no opinions on the subject of jw:is­
prudence ; or political history, in one who embraced no 
theory of politics. It is hard to see why it should be 
otherwise with the hist01·y of Philosophy. How can 
the historian even understand the doctrines of the 
philosophers; by what standard is he to judge of their 
importance; how can he discern the internal connedion 
of the systems, or form any opinion respecting their 
reciprocal relations, unless he is guided in his labours 
by fixed philosophic principles ? But the more de­
veloped and mutually c.oonsistent these principles are, 
the more must we ascribe to him a definite system ; and 
since clearly developed and consisknt. principles are 
undoubtedly to be desired in a writer of hi~tory, we 
cannot avoid the conclusion tba.t it is necessary and 
good that he should bring with him to the study of t.hc 
earlier Philosophy a philosophic system of his mvn.

It is possible, indeed, that his system may be too 
contracted t{i interpret for him the men,ning of his 
pmfocessors ; it is itlso possible that he may apply it to 
history in a perverse manner, by introducing his own 
opinions into the doctrines of previous philosophers, 
and const.rncting out of his own system that which he 
should have tried to understand by it:l help, But we 
must not make the general principl8 answerable for 
these faults of individuah; and still less can we hope 
to escape them by entering on the history of Philosophy 
devoid of any philo8ophic conviction. The human mind 
is not like a tabula rasa, the fact8 of history are not 
simply reflected in it like a picture on a photogmphic 
plate, but every view of a given occurrence is arrived at 
by independent observation, combination, and judgment 
of the foots. Philosophic impartiality, therefore, does 
not consist in the absence of all presuppositions, hut in 
bringing to the study of pa~t evcnfa presuppositions 
that are true. The man who is without any philo­
sophic stand-point is not on that account without any 
stand-point whatever; he who has formed no scientific 
opinion on philosophic questions has au unscientific 
opinion about them. To say that we should bring to 
the history of Philosophy no philosophy of our own, 
really means that in dealing with it we should give the 
preference to unscient.ific notions as compared with 
~cientific ideas. And the sarne reasoning would apply 
to the assertion 1 that the historian ought to form hi8 
sy,;tem in the course of writing his history, from history 
itself; that by means of history he is to emancipate

attain the universal and the true. From what point of 
view then is he to regard history, that it may do him 
this ~ervice? From the false and narrow point of view 
which he must quit that he may rightly comprehend 
history ? or from the universal point of -dew whfoh 
hi~tory itself must first enable him to attain? The 
one is mauife~tly a~ impracticable a.s the other, and we 
are ultimately confined within this circle: that he alone 
completely uuderntauds the history of Philo~ophy who 
po~sesses true and complete philosophy; and that hE 
only arrives at true philosophy who is led to it bJ 
under;,.tanding history. ~or can this circle ever be 
entirely escape<l: t.he history of Philosophy is the test 
of the truth of systems; and to have a philosophic 
sygtcm i~ the condition of a man's understanding history. 
The truer and the more comprehensive a philosophy is, 
the better will it teach us the impurtance of previous 
philosophies; and the more uninte1ligiblc we find the 
history of Philosophy, the greilter reason have we to 
doubt the truth of our own philosophic cm1ceptiom. 
But the only conclu~ion to be dmwn from thi~ i~ that 
we ought never to rf\gard the work of sciernici as finished _

ORIGIN OF GREEK I'HILOSOPRY. 
§ I.-Is Gmek Philoso11h?/ derfoed from Oriental 
S1Jecnlation ? 
IN order to explain the growth of Greek Philosophy, we 
must. first. enquire out of what historical conditions it 
arose ; whether it evolved itself as a native product. 
from the spirit and culture of the Greek people, or was 
transplanted from without into Hellenic soil, and grew 
up under foreign influences. The Greeks, we know, 
were early inclined to aBcribe to the East.em nations 
(the only nations whose culture preceded their own) a 
$bare in the origin of their philosophy ; but in the most 
ancient period, certain isolated doct.rines merely were 
thus derived from the J<:itst.1 Aii far ail our information 
extends, not the Greeks, but the Oriental.;, were the 
first to attribute such an origin to Greek Philosophy 
generally. The Jews of the Alexandrian school, edu­
cated under GrMk infiuenees, sought by means of this 
theory to explain the supposed hannony of their sacred 
writings with the doctrines of the Hellenes, a1:,•reeably 
to their own ~tand-point and interests ; 2 and in the same 
manner the Egyptian priests, after they had become

be ascribed to the same somce; aud the more difficulty 
there was in explaining these doctrines from native 
traditiou, the m!Jre readily was their origin attributed 
to races, long since revered as lhe teachers of the 
Greeks, and whose wisdom enjoyed the highest reputa­
tion, because the unknown has generally a charm for 
the imagination, and seen, as it must be, through a 
mysterious haze, is wont to look greater than it Teally 
is. 'I'hus, after the period of Neo-l'ythagorcism there 
spread, chiefly from Alexandria, the belief that the most 
important of the-ancient philosop\iers had been in­
structeu by Eastern priests and ;;age-s, and that theiT 
mo~t, characteristic doctrines had been taken fmm Jhis 
source. Thi~ opinion in the following centuries be­
came more and more general, ancl the later Ne;­
Platonists especially carried it to such an extent that., 
according to them, the philosophers had beeu scurcely 
more than the promulga.tors of doctrines perfected age8 
before in the traditions of the· Asiatic races. No wonder 
that Christian aut.hors, even after the time of the Refor­
mat.ion, continued the same strain, doubting neither the 
Jewish statements as to the dependence of Greek Philo­
sophy on the religion of the Old Testament, nor the 
stories which marlc Phaonicians, Egyptians, Persians, 
Babylonians and Hindoos the instrud01·8 of the ancient

Grer,k sages with ]Hoses and the prophets; but the idea 
that Greek Philosophy partly or entirely originated in 
the Pagan East has morr, facts to urge in it:s behalf. 
'It has also found support in the high opinion of Oriental 
wisdom induced by our better acquaintance wit.h the 
Chinese, Persian and Indian sacred records, arnl by our 
researches into Eg_yptian antiquity; an opinion which 
ha1monizes with certain philosophical specnlations con­
cerning a primith·c revelation and a golden age. '\fore 
soher philosoph.r, indeed, qucRtfoned the t.ruth of these 
Bpecnlations, and thoughtful students of hi3f.ory sought 
vainly for traces of that high culture which was said 
to have adorned the childhood of the world. Our1 
admiration, too, for the Oriental Philosophy, of which, 
according to its ent,husia;;tic admirers, only some frag­
ments had reached the Greeks, has been considerably 
modified by om growing knowledge of its true content 
and character. '\-Yhen, i~ addition to this, the old un­
criUcal manner of confusing separate modes of thought 
had been abandoned, and every notion began to he 
Rtudied in its historical connection, and in relation with 
the peculiar chani.c•ter and circumstances of the people 
among whom it appeared, it was natural that the. differ­
ences of Greek aud Orient.al cultivation, and the self­
dcpendenc:e of the Greek, should tLgain be more strongly 
emphasized by those best acquainted with classical :-inti­
quity. Still, there have not been wanfcing, even quite 
recently, some t.o maintain that the Enst had a decisive 
influence Qn the earliest Greek Philosophy; and the whole 
question seem,; hy no mearn so entirely settled that the 
History of Philosophy can avoid its repeated discussion.

30 LYTRODUCTiffN. 
One point, however, is to be noted, the neglect of 
which 1ms not unfrequent.ly brought confusion into this 
enquiry. In a certain sense, the influence of Oriental 
conceptions on Greek Philosophy urns well be admitted 
even by those who consider tl1at Philosophy to be purely 
a Greek creation. The Greeks, like the other Indo­
Gcrmauic races, arose out uf Asfo,, and from this then· 
earliest home they must originally have brought with 
them, together with their language, the general ground­
work of their religion and manners. After they had 
reached their later abodes, they were still open to in­
fluences which reached them from the Oriental nations, 
partly through Thrace and the Bosphoru~, partly Ly 
way of the JEgean and its islands. The national 
character of Greece, therefore, was eve11 in its origin 
under t.he influence of the Oriental spirit, and Greek 
religion, especially, can only be undero1tood on the sup­
position that foreign rites aud religious ideas from the 
North and South-east were supcrndded to the faith of 
Greek antiquity, and, in a lesser degree, even to that of 
the Homeric age. The latest of these immigrant gods, 
such as Dionysm, Cybele, and the Phcenician Heracles, 
can now with sufficient certainty be proved alien in 
their origin ; while in the case of othern, in the present 
stag-e of the enquiry, we have still to be content with 
doubtful conjectures. Iu comidering the Oriental 
origin of Greek philosophy, however, we can only take 
into account t}1ose Eastern influences, t,he entrance of 
which had nothing to do with the early religion of 
Greece, or the development of the Greek character 
generally; for the scope of our work involves our re-

garding the philosophy of the Greeks, at any rate 
primarily, a;; a product of the Greek spirit; and to 
enquire how that spirit was formed would be he~ide the 
purpose of the Histmy of Philosophy. Only in so far 
a,; the Oriental clement xnaintained itself in its specific 
character, side by side with the Hellenic elernent, are 
we now concerned with it. If, indeed, Roth were cor­
rect in asserting, as he doe,i,1 that l'hilosophy <lid uot 
spring from the civilisation and spiritual life of the 
Greeks, but was transplanted among them as something 
foreign, and that the whole circle of notions lying at 
its root came ready made from without,, then, and then 
only, we might derive Greek l'hilo~ophy absolutely 
from the East. But if, on the other }iand, it was the 
immediate product of the Greek philosophers' own re­
flection, in that case it has essentially a native origin, 
and the.question can no longer be whether, as a whole, it 
came from the East, but whether Oriental doctrines had 
any share in ifa formation, how far this foreign influence 
extended, and to ,vhat exten we can still recognize in 
it the Oriental element proper, a~ diHtinet from the 
Hellenic element. These different cases have not 
always hitherto been sufficiently disC1·iminated; and 
the advocates of Oriental influence especially have fre­
quently neglected to explain whether the foreign 
clement came into Philosoplly directly or through the 
medium of the Greek religion. There is a wide differ­
ence between the two altematives, and it is with the 
fo:rmer alone that we are here concerned.

ally came from the East, support, their opm10n partly 
ou the statements of the ancients, and partly on the 
~upposed internal affinity 1Jctwccn Greek and Oriental 
rlocfaines. The first of these proofs is very unsatisfac­
tory. Later writers, it is true, particularly the adher­
ents of the Neo-Pythagoreau and Xco-Plalonic Sclwols, 
<>peak much of the wisdom which Thales, Pherecydes and 
Pythagora8, DemoeriLus ancl Plato, mvecl to the teaching 
of Egyptian priests, Chaldeans, l\fagi, aml even Brah­
mans. But this evidence could only be valid if we were 
as;;;med that it rested on a trustworthy tradition, reac11ing 
back to the time of the~e philosophilrs themselves. And 
who can guarantee us such an assurance? The assertions 
of these eomparutiwJy recent authors respecting the 
ancient philosophers must be cautiously received even 
when they mention their refereuces; for their historical 
sense aud critical faculty are alrno:;;t inHriably so dull, 
all(l the dogmatic presuppositions of subsequent philo­
sophy are $0 intrusively apparent in their l:mguage, that 
we c:in trust very few of tlwm even for a correct version 
of their authmitie:-;, and in no single imtance cm1 we 
hope for a sound judgment concerning the worth and 
origin of those authorities, or an accw-at.e <liscrirnination 
of the genuine from the spurious, the fabulous from the 
historic. Indeed, -v,·hen anything-, otherwise unknown to 
us, is related by them of Plato, Pythagoras, or any of the 
ancient philosopher~ without any reforence to authori­
ties, we may takf1 fOl' granted that the story is founded, 
in the great majority of cases, neither on fr,ct nor on 
respectable tradition, but at bflst on som1-, unauthenti­
cated rumour, and st.ill oftener, perhaps, on a mi~umle1·-

stanrling, an tu-hitr,try conjecture, a dogmatic presuppo­
sition, or even a delibera.te invention. This is true in 
an e~p8cial manner of the question as to the relation of 
Greek Philosvvhy with the Ea..st; for, on the one hand, 
the Orientals bad the strongest inducements of vanity 
and ~elf-intere,;t f{J inve11t an Ea8tern origin for Grer,k 
:,ciern'.e and culture; and, on t.hc other, the Greeks were 
only too rearly to allow the claim. It is precisely with 
such unautlienticated gtatcmenfa that we have here to 
do, and these statements m·e so snspiciously eonncct.ed 
with tl1e peculiar standpoint of the authors who make 
them, tlmt it would be very rnsh to build hypothese8 of 
6>Teat importance in history on a founda.tion so insecure. 
If we· put. aside, then, the~c untrmitworthy witnesses, 
and h:we recourne to older authorities, the result is no 
better; we find either that they asPert much less than 
t.he later wr:it(;;rs, or tha.t. their assertions are based far 
more upon conjeeture than historical knowledge. Thales 
may have been in Egypt: we lrn.vc no certain evidence 
of the fact ; , but it fa not lih,ly that he them learned 
more than the first rudiments of mathematic.~. That 
Pythagoras visited that country, aml that his whole 
philo~ophy originated t.he\1ce, was first a8serted by 
Isocrates, in a pass11ge which is more than suspected of 
being a rhetvrical fiction. Herodotu~ says nothing 
about his having come to Egypt, and rnprrsents him 
as having derived from the Egyptians only a very ff'w 
doctrines and customs, ancl th.,~e at. thini hand. The

3G INTRODUCTION. 
Gladisch thinks he pe1·ceives, even supposing it to exist, 
would admit of a twofold explanation. V{ e might 
either ascribe it to an actual connection between the 
Pythagorean Philosophy and the Chinese, between the 
Eleatic an<l the Himluo, &c. ; or we might regard the 
coincidence of il1csc doct.rincs as uaturally resulting, 
without any exlernal connection, from. the uniYersalit.y 
of the Greek g·enius, or some other cause. In the 
latter case the phenomenon would give 110 clue to the 
origin of Greek Philo8ophy, nor, however striking sunh 
a fact might appear to ns, would it add ruuch to our 
historical knowledge of Greek science. If, on the 
other hand, there were really such an external historical 
connection ,1.,.; Gladisch assumes I between these Greek 
systems an<l their Eastern prototypes, we ought to be 
able in some way or other to prove the possihility of 
such a connection ; to show, from a sw-vey of the actual 
circumstances, that there was a probability of such 
~curate intelligence concerning Chinese and Hindoo 
doctrines having reached Pythagorn:,; and Pannenidea; 
we must e:x.plain the inconceivable phenomenon that the 
different Oriental idea.s did not become intermingled 
on their way t.o Greece, nor in Greece itBelf, but 
arrived there and· maintained themselves separately, 
side by side, so as to produce exactly tht, samo number 
of Greek systems, and that in the very order corre­
spondin1,?: to the geogTapbical and historical position 
of the peoples am(.lng whom they arose. La~tly, we 
must give some kind of answer to the riuestion how 
theories, so cvi<lcntly borrowed from ParmenidA~ by

Empedocl1os and Anaxagom~, and so deeply rooted in 
their own doctrines that they must be considered their 
scientific points of departure ( e.g. the irnpossihllity of 
an absolute origination or decease), could be derived in 
the case of one philosopher from India, in that of a 
secoml from Egypt, iu tlmt of a third from PalcHtine. 
All this appears equally impossible, whether we suppose 
the influence of Oriental docttineR on Greek Philosophy 
to have been indirect or direct. That it is irnpos~ible 
to believe in a direct influence of the kind G-ladisch 
himself admits; 1 appealing, -with ju~tice, to Lhc ut­
terances of Aristotle and of the other ancient authors 
concerning the origin of the system~ anterior to Plato, 
and urging the rcci procal intc.rdepcndeuce of these 
systems. But does the theory become more probable if 
we assume that the Oriental clement 'entered Philo­
sophy through the instrnmentality of Greek religion?' 2 
\\'hr.rc do we find in Greek religion, especially in the 
religiou~ tradition of the centmies which ga.-e birth 
to the pre-Socratic Philosophy ( exct:pt, indeed, in the 
dogma of transmigration), a trace of all the doctrines 
to v.foch the philosophers arc said to have been led by 
it ? How is it credible that n speoulative system like 
the Vedanb1 Pl1ilosophy shoul<l be communicated by 
means of Greek mythology to Parrneuides; and J urbic 
monotheism, by means of Hellenic polytheism, t,o 
Anaxagoras? How could the Oriental doctrines after 
their convergence in the Greek religion h,we is~ued 
from it uncbangeu in this definite order ? And

as INTRODUCTION. 
if thiq ha<l done so, how can that which the various 
philosophies produced from tl1c same soLrrce ( their na­
tional religion), even when they undoubterUy borrowed 
it one from the other, he referred to utterly different 
Oriental ;,onrccs? It is easy to meet these objectiom, 
which might be greatly multiplied, hy saying,1 whether 
all this be possible, and how it may have come about, 
we will not here enquire, but content owBelves at 
present with simply establishing the facts. Such an 
answer might suffice if the evidenee for the facts only 
included the hearing-of unimpeachable witne8~es, and 
a compaTison of their testimony. But that is by no 
means the case. The proofs of the parallelism between 
Greek and Oriental doctrines whieb Gladisd1 olaims 
to h:we discovered, would, under any circumstanccs, 
demand investigations much too complicatt,d to lean: 
the question of its possibility and reasonableness wholly 
untnuchf'd. If we consider his own representation of 
this parallelism, we am met at decisive points by such 
uncritical reliance on interpolated writings and untrust­
,rnrthy statements, such confusion of earlier and later 
authmities, such arbitrary intcrprdation of the theories 
concerned, that it is plain we have t.o do not merely 
with t11e proof of the historical fact, but with a connec­

become involved, as ah·carly remarked, in the following 
contradictions: that characteristics equally to be found 
in several Greek philosophers must havn had an entirely 
different origin in every case; t.hat doctrines cvidcnt1y 
horrowi;d by one philosopher from another mUBt hflve 
been communicated independent.ly to both from an 
Eastern rnw·cc, and to eat:h man from a separate Eastern 
source; 1 that systems which evolved themselves out of 
one another, in a historic sequence which is indisputable, 
must each have merely reproduced what it, had already 
recein:d, irrespectively of that sequence, from this or 
that Oriental predecessor. Ilow little this construction 
of Gladi~eh comports with actual facfa may also be 
r;ccn from the impossibility~ of bringing into connection 
with it two such radical and important phenomena in 
the histor_y of G.reek Philosophy a~ the fonie Physics 
before lleracleitus, and the Atomistic Philosophy. 
As to Roth, his view can only be properly considered 
jn the examination of the separate Greek systems. 
So far as it is carried out., I am, however, unable to 
agree with it, brcause I foil to see in his exposition of 
Egyptian theology a faithful historical picture. I can-

by Roth between the Egyptian Rnd l'ersian doctrines, 
rrnd the myths and philosophic systems of the Greeks, 
can only be proved, even 10n tl1c author's own showing, 
if we consent to repose unlimited confidence in untrust­
worthy witnesses, uo.certa.in conjeetures and groumlles8 
etymologies. If, jndeed, each transference of the nameH 
of Greek g-ods,to foreign deities were an adequate proof 
of the identity of the;;f: gods, the Greek religion would 
hardly be distjnguishable from the l<:gyptiun; if it -were

INTRO.D UC1'ION. 
A proof of this kiud is, generally speaking, very 
difficult to establish when it is ba8cd ,mlely on inkrnal 
evidence. It may happen that not only particular 
notions and customs, but whole series of them may bea.r 
a. resemblance to a.nother series in Home other sphere of 
civilisation ; it may also happen Omt furnlamental c:on­
ceptions may seem tu repeat tbemselve:,i without thn~ 
affording adequate proof that they are historically inter­
connected. Under analogous conditions of develop· 
ment, and especially between races originally related 
to each other, many points of contact invariably arise, 
even when these races have . no actual intercourse; 
dmnce often brings out surpl'ising similarities in de­
tails ; and among the more highly civilised mces scarcely 
any two could be named between which .~triking p:ual­
lels could not be drawn. :Hut though it may he natural 
in that case fo conjecture an external connection, the 
existence of this connection is only probable if tLe 
similarities are so great that they cannot be explained 
hy the above more gencrnl causes. It must. }mvc been 
Yery astonishing to the followers of Alexander to find 
among the B1-ahmans not only their Dionysus and 
Heracles, but al~o t.heit-Hellenic philosophy ; to hear 
of wafor being t.he origin of the world, as with Thales ; 
of Deity pe1·meating all things, as with lleracleitus ; of 
a transmigration of souls, as with Pythagoras and Plato; 
of tive elements, as with Aristotle; of the prohibition 
of flesh diet, as ·with Empedocles and the Orphics; 1

bccn often inclined to de1·ivc Greek doctrines and mllges 
from Egypt. But for us, all this is not sufficient proof 
that Heracleitus, Plato, Thales aud Aristotle borrowed 
their theorems from the IIindoos or Egyptians. 
It is not merely, hm,;,ever, the want of historical 
evidence which prevents our believing in the Oriental_ 
origin of Greek Philmophy; there are several positive 
rea8ons against the theury. One of the mo~t cleei~ive' 
.lie~ in the general charac.ter of that philo~ophy. The 
doct.rines of the most ancient Greek philosophers have, 
as Ritter well ohsc:tves,1 all the simplieit,y and indepen­
dence of firs_L~-t~smpts; and their ulterior development 
fo su continuous t.ha.t. the hypothesis of alien influence,; 
is neveT required to explain it. V{ e see here no conflict 
of the original Hellenil'. spirit with foreign elements, no 
adaJJhttion of misapprehemh:d formul""' and conceptions, 
no return to scientific traditions of the past, in shoti, 
none of the phenomena by ·which, for example, in the 
JHidclle Age~, the: dependence of phiJmmphy on foreign 
somTes is evinced. All developes itself quite natm-ally 
from the conditions of Greek national life, ancl we shall 
find that even those ~ystern~ which have been ~upposed 
to be most deeply influenced by doctrines from wit.liout, 
are in all essential respects to be explained by the inter­
nal ei v ili~ation and spiritual horizon o.f the Hellene8. 
Such a feature would certainly he inexplicable if Greek 
Philosophy were really :;o much indebted to other 
couut.rics as some writers both aneicnt and modern 
have believed. On this theory there would l1c another

theological eharacter of Oriental speculation should be 
entirely absent from Greek philosophy. Whate-ver 
scicnc,: there was in Eg·ypt, Babylouia or Pr:rsiu, was in 
possession of the priestly ca~te, and had · grown up in 
one mass with the teligious doctrines and institutions. 
In regaxd to mathematics and ashonomy, it is quite 
conceivable that Orienta.l science should have been de­
tached from this its religious basis, and tmn~planted 
separately into foi·eign lands ; but it is most irnp1·obable 
that the prie~ts should have held theories about the 
primitive constituents and origin of the world, capable 
of being tmnsmitkd and adopted ap,Lrt from thdr doc­
trines concerning t,he gods and mythology. Now in the 
most ancient Greek Philosophy we find no trace of 
Egyptian, Persian or Chaldamn mythology, and its con­
nection even with Greek myths is wry slight. Even 
the Pythagorean.: ;'ind Empedocles only honowed from 
the mysteries such doctr-ines as had no intimate relation 
with tbeir philosophy (that is, their attempt at a scien­
tific explanation of n;'lture) : ~either the Pythagorean 
doctrine of numbers, nor the Pythagorean and Ernpe­
clodean cosmology, can be connected with any t.hcologi­
cal traditi()ll as tlu:ir ~omce. The rest of the pre­
Socratic philosophy does, indeed, remind us in certain 
isolated notions of the mythic cosmogony, hut in the 
main it developed itself either quite independently of 
the re1igious belief, or in express opposition to it. How 
could this possibly be if Greek science were an offshoot 
of the sa.certlotal wisdom of the E:u,t ? 
"\V c must further enquire whether the Greeks at the 
time of their first attempts at Philosophy cow.kl have

logical notions~ but all these, so far as they really appear

Plato, judging from the prcvioudy quoted passage in

XATIVE SOURCES OP GREEK PIIILOS01'HY. 49 
If we ask oursc1ves, lastly, by what mean,; the doctrines 
of the Hindoos and Uie other nations of Eastern Asia 
could have been carried into Greece before the time 
of Alexander, we shall find that the matter presents 
numerous difficulties. All such considerations as the,~e 
woLllrl, of cours1c,, yield to well~attested facts ; but it is 
a different matter where we are c•on<ieTned, not with 
}1istorical fads, but for the present with mere conjec­
tmes. If the Eastern origin of Greek Philosophy were 
to be maintained by trustworthy evidence, or by its own 
internal eha.racteristics, our conception of the scientitic 
condition of the Ea,;tem nationR and of the relation in 
which the Greeks stood to them must be formed in 
accordance wit11 that fact; but since the fact in itself 
is neither clemomtrable nor probable, it is rendered 
stiU more impmbable by its want of harmony with what 
we know from other ~ource~ on these two points.

,vere that people. In the most ancient records ()f t,heir 
culture, the Homeric Poems, we already meet with that 
freedom and clearness of spirit, that sobriety and mode­
ration, that feeling for the beautiful and harmonious, 
which p1ace these poems so distinctly above the heroic

J;,gends of all other nations without exception. Of 
scientific endeavour, there is noth-ing a~ yet; no neces­
sity is felt to investigate the natural causes of things; 
the write1· is content to refer them to personal authorn 
and divine powers, the explanation that come:,; upper­
most in the childhood of mankind. The technical arh 
too, which support science, arc in a very elementary 
stage; in the Homeric periocl even writing is unknown. 
But when we consider the gloriom: herotis of the Homeriu 
Poems-when we see how everything, each phenomeno11 
of natme, and cac11 event of human life, is :,et forth in 
picture;, which are as true as they are artistically per­

ment of these mnstcrpicccs, the grandeur of their plan, 
and the harmonious accomplishment of their purposes, 
we can no longer wonder that a nation capable of ap­
prehending the world with an eye so open, a.nd a Bpirit 
so unclouded, of dominating the confo~ed maRs of phe­
nomena with so admirable a sense of form, of moving 
in life so freely and surely-tbr.t such a nation should 
soon tnrn it~ attention to science, and in that field 
should not be satisfied merely with amassi1Jg knowledge

element in Oriental and Northern mythology) that this 
fabled world is wanting i.n the conditions of realit,y ! 
Amidst. all the poetry how clearly we recognise that 
sane and vigorous realism, t.hat ·fine perception of whut 
is harmonious and natmal, to which, in later times, 
after deeper ~tudy of the uni.verse and of man, this 
same Homeric heaven necessarily proved such a stum­
bling-block. Thus, altho11gh the intellectua,l culture 
of the Horne1·ic period is separated by a wide inter­
val from the rise of philoSDphy, we can already trace 
in it the peculiar genius out of which Philosophy 
sprang. 
It is the farther developm@t of this genius as 
manifested in the sphere of religion, of moral and civil 
life, and in the general cultivation of taste and of the 
intellect, which constitutes the historical preparation for 
Greek Philosophy. 
The religion of the Greeks, like every positive 
religion, stands to the philosophy of that people in a 
relalion partly of affinity and partly of opposition. 
What distinguiHhes it from the religions of. all other 
races,. however, is the \[:eedom which from the very \ 
beginning it allowed to the evolution of philosophic 
thought. , If we turn our attention first to tl,e public 
ritual arid popular faith of the Hellenes, as it is repre­
Htmtcd' to us in its oldest anrl most authentic records, 
the poems of Homer and Hesiod, its importance in the 
development of philo~ophy cannot be mistaken. The 
religious preHentation is always, and so also among the 
Greek~, the form in which the interdependence of all 
phenomena and the rnle of invisible poweni and uni-·

versal laws first attains to cornciousness. However 
great may be the distance between faith in a divine 
government of the world, and the scientific knowledge 
a.nd explanation of the uni,•er&e as a eonnectcd whole, 
they have at any rate something in common. Religions 
faith, 1oven under the polytheistic fonn it ftssumed in 
Greece, implies that what exists and happens in the 
world depends on certain causes concealed from sensu­
ous perception. Xor fa this all. The power of the 
gods must necessarily extend OYer all parts of the world, 
and the plurality Qf the gods is reduced to unity by 
the domi11ion of Zeus and the frresistiblc power of 
, Fate. Thus the interdependence of the universe is 
(,;proclaimed ; all plienomena are co-ordinated under the 
· same general causes ; by degrees fear of the power of 
the gods and of relentless Fate yields to confidence in 
the divine goodness and wisdom, and a fresh problem 
presents itself to reflection-viz. to pursue the trace!' of 
this wisdom in t1rn laws of the universe. Philosophy, 
indeed, has itself been at work in this purification of 
the popular faith, bnt the religions notion first con­
tained the germs from wllich the purer conceptions of 
Philosophy were afterwards developed. 
The peonliar nature of Greek religious belief, also, 
was not without influence on Greek Philosophy. The 
Greek religion belongs in its general character to the 
class of natural religions; tbe Divine, as is sufficiently 
proved by the plurality of gods, is represented under 
a natural :figure essentially of the 8ame kind as the 
Finite, and only exalted above it in degree. Man, 
therefore, does not need to raise himself above t,he

world that smrounds him, and above his own actual 
nature, that hF- may ente:r into communion with the 
Deity; he feels himself 1·elated to God from the very 
outset. No internal change of his moje of thought, 
no struggle with his natural impulses and inclinations, 
is demanded of him ; on the contrary, all that fo in 
human nature is le~.-itimate in the sight of God-t.lie 
most godlike man is he who cultivates his human powers 
most effectually, and religions duty c:s,ent.ially consists 
in. man's doing to the glory (Jf God that wliich ~s ac~ 
cording to his own nature. The same stand-point is 
evident in the Philosophy of the Greeks, as will be 
shown further on; and, though the philosopher,; as a 
rule, took few of their doctrin1c;s dirccUy fruru religious 
tradition, and wore often openly at vari;;111ce with the 
popular faith, still it is clear that the mode of thought 
to which the Hellenes had become accustomed in their 
religion was not without influence on their scientific 
tendencies. It was inevitable that from the naturalistic 
religion of Greece there should arise, in the first in-· 
stance, a naturalistic philosophy. 
'l'he Greek religion, furthermorn, is distinguished 
from other naturalistic religions in that it assigns the 
highest place in existence nei.ther to external nature, 
rwr to the sensuous nature of man, as such, but to hu­
man nature that is 11ea11tiful and transfigured by spirit. 
nfan is not, as in the East, so entirely the slave of 
external impressions that he loses his own independence 
in the forces of nature, and feels that he is bnt a 
part uf nutme, irresistibly involved in its vicis~itudes.

INTRODUCTION. 
freedom of rude and half-.savage races. But, while 
liYing and aeting with the full seme of liberty, he coD­
siders that the highest exercise of that liberty is to 
ouey the universal order as the Jaw of his own nature. 
Although, therefore, in this religion, Deity is conceived 
as similar to man, it is not common human nature that 
is ascribed to it. l'{ ot only is the outer form of the 
gods idealised a~ the image of the pure~t beauty, but 
their essential nature, especially in the case of the 
Hellenic gods proper, is formed by ideals of human 
activities. The relation of the Greek to his gods was 
therefore free and happy to an extent that we find in no 
other nation, because his own nature was reflected antl 
idealised iu them; so that, in contemplating them, he 
found hiwsel\ at once attracted by affinity, and elBvated 
above the limits of his own existence, without having 
to purchase this boon by the paiu and trouble of an in­
terrial conflict. Tln:.s, the sensuous and natural become 
the immediate embodiment of the spiritual ; the whole 
1·eligion assumes an aesthetic character, religious ideas 
take the form of poetry; divine worship and the 
o~ject of that wor:lhip are ruade material for art; and 
though we are still, speaking generally, on the lcyel of 
naturalistic religion, nature is only regarded as the 
manifestation of Deity, because of the spiTit which re­
veab itself in nature. '.!'his idealistic character of the 
Greek religion was no doubt of the highest importance 
in the origin and formation of Greek philosophy. The 
exercise of the iIDagimttfon, which gives twiversal 
significa.ncc to the particulars of sense, is the prepara­
tory shige for the exercise of tbc intellect which, nl-
8/22
www.holybooks.com

THE RELIGION OJ/ 1'HE GREEKS. 55 
stracting from the particular as such, seeks for the 
general essence and universal causes of phenomena. 
·while, therefore, the Greek religion was 1)ased upon an 
ideal and resthetie vimv of the world, and encouraged to 
the ut.most all a-rtistic activity in setting forth this view, 
it must have bad indirectly ·a sf.imulating and emancipa­
ting effect upon tliought, and have prepared the way 
for the scientific study of things. From a Y,uiterial 
:_:10int of view, this ide,LliHtic tendency of religion was 
beneficial principally to Ethics; hut from a formctl 
point of view, the infl.nencc of religion extended to all 
parts of Philosophy ; for Philowphy presupposes (Ind 
Tf'.fluircs an ende:wour to t,:eat tl1e se11sible as a manifes­
tation of spirit., aud to trace it back to spiritual causes. 
~ome of the Greek philosophers may possibly have been 
too rash in their procedure in that respect ; hnt this 
we shall not at present consider. The more readily we 
admit that their doct.rines often give us the impression 
of a philosophic poem full of bold inventions, rather 
than a work of science, the more clearly we shall see 
the connection of those doctrines with the artistic 
genius of the Greek nation, and with the rcsthetic 
character of its religion. 
But although Greek Philosophy may owe much to 
reli~,ion, it owes wore to the circumstance that its de­
pendrnce on religion rnwer went so far as to prevent, or 
essentially to restrict, the free movement of science. 
The Greeks had no hierarchy, and no inviolable dog­
matic code. The sacerdotal functions were not with 
. them the e:x:clusive property of a class, nor were the priests 
the only mediators betweien the gods and men; but

each individual for himself, and ench community for 
itself, had a right to offer up sacrifices and prayers. In 
Homer, we find kings and chiE'fa sacrificing for their 
subjects, fathers for their familic~, each person for him­
self, without t}1e intervention of priests, Eveu at a later 
period, when the development of a public cult in temples 
gave more jmpol't,ance to the sacerdotal order, the fnuc­
tions of the prfosts\vere always limited to certain offer­
ings and ceremonial observances in their pa.rtieuhr 
localities; prayers and sacrifices were still offered hy the 
lait.y, nnd a whole class of matter.s relating to religious 
ce1·emonial were left, not to priest,, but to public :ti.mc­
tiona.ries designated by election, or by lot-in pii.rt in 
combination with officers of the community or state~ 
to individuals and heads of families. The priests, 
therefore, as a class, could never acquire an influential 
position in Greece at all comparable with that wbich 
they enjoyed among the Oriental nations.1 Priests of 
certain temples, it is true, did attain to con,siderablo 
importanee on account. of the oracles connected with 
those temples, but, 011 the whole, the priestly office con­
ferred far more honour than inflnence; it was a politi­

The ideas ai1d traditions wbich the Greek races brol1ght 
with them from their original abodes were carried by 
each individual tribe, community and family into dif­
ferent rnrroundings, and 8Ubjected t.o influeuces of tl1e 
wost various kinds. Thus, there arose a multiplicity 
of local rites and legen<l3 ; and from these, a common 
Hellenic faith gradually developed itselt~ not by the 
Hystematising of theology, but by a free convergence 
of minds ; in -which convergence the mD~t important 
factor, he8idc the personal intercourse and religious 
ceremonies of the 11ational games and festi ,·al~, was Art, 
and above all, Poetry. This explains the fact, that in 
Greece there was never, properly ~peaking, a system of 
religions doctrine generally adrnitterl., but only a myth­
ology; and that the conception of orthodoxy was abso­
lutely unknown. Every one was indeed required to 
honour the gods of t.he Rt.ate; and those who were

GS INTRODUCTION. 
though Philosophy itself was thus hardly dealt with, 
in the person of some of its representatives, on tbe 
whole, the relation of individuals to the faith of the 
community was far fnoer than among nationd who 
possr;so:ed a defo;iitc confession of faith g:uarJed by 
a powerful priesthood. The severity of the Greeks 
against religious innovation had immediate Tefercncc 
not to doctrines, but to cult; ouly so far as a doctrine 
·sermt>d to involve consequences prejudicial to pnhlic 
worship did it beeome the object of attack. As to 
theological opinions, properly :,.,o c:ocl]ed, tbey were left 
unmolested. The Greek religion possessed neither a 
body of theolog·ieal doctrine uor w1it.ten ~acred rec•ords. 
It was founded entirely npon traditions respecting 
the temples, rlcscriplions of the poets, and notions of 
the people: moreovlc'r, thcne was scarcely any tradition 
which was not confradicteu by others, and in th,tt ,-.ay 
lost much of its authority. Tims, in Greece, faith was 
r.oo indefinite and elastic in its form to admit of its 
exercising· upon reawn either an internal supremacy, 
or an external restraint, to the extent that we find to 
have been the case iu other countrie-,,. 
This free attitude of Greek: science in respect to 
religion was full of important resulti;, as will be evi­
dent if we consider what would have become of Greek 
Philosophy, and indirectly of our own, without this · 
freedom. All the historical analogiei; that \Ve can adduce 
will give us liut one answer ; namely, that the Greeks 
would then have been as little able as the Oriental na-
tions to attain an independent philosophic science. 
The speculative impulse might indeed have been a.wake,

but,jealously watched as it would have been by theology, 
internally cramped by n,ligions pn~snppoziitions, and 
shackled in its free movcmen t, thought could scarcely 
have produced anytlting more than a religious specula­
tion ukin tu the ancient thcolog-ic cmmologies; and 
e.-en supposing that at a much later period it had 
turned to otber questions, it could TIC\'er have had the 
acuteness, freshness, and freedom by which the Philo­
sophy of Grce/!e became the teacher of all the ag1o8. 
The Hindoos ,vero tlrn most speculative nation of the 
East, and their civilisation was of the highest antiquity, 
yiot how greatly inferior were they, as regards philoso­
phic achie,•ement, to the Greeks ! The same mmt be 
said of the Christian and ::\.foharnmedan Philosophy in 
the Middle Ages, thought.bis had the ad vantage of being 
pn:<:eded by tLe Greek. In both cases, the principal· 
cause of the inferiority manifestly lay in t1ie tlepen-/ 
clence of seience npon positive dogma~; and foe Greek,, 
are l.o be comitlered us siuguhrly fort1;nate in having\ 
escaped this dependence thrnugh the force of their j 
peculiar genius, and the favourable course of their his-/ 
torica1 development,. ,} 
It has liecn usmtlly supposed that between Philo­
wpby ,rnd the religion of the mysteries a closer hond 
exists. In the mysteries, according io this view, a 
pnrer, or at any rate a more speculative, theology was 
imparted to the initiated ; and, by means of the mys­
teTie~, the secret doctrines of Eastern priests were tram;­
mitted to the Greek pbilo8ophcrs, and through them to 
the Greek people in general. But this theory has no 
lJptter foundation than the one we have jnst been di~-

mrnsing rn regard to Oriental Sciem:e. lt is proved 
beyond a doubt, by the most recent and thorough 
inVf,stigations 1 of the suqject, that originally no philo­
,;ophic doctrines were conveyed in these religious cere­
monies ; and that at a later period, when such doctrines 
began to be connected with the mysteries, this occurred. 
under the influence of scientific researches. Philosophy, 
therefore, should be regm·dcd rather as having imparted 
wisdom to the mysteries than as having received it from 
them. The mxst.eries were originally, af\ we have every 
reason to believe, ritualistic mlemnities, which, in their 
religious import and character, differed nothing· from 
the public worship of the gods, and were only carried on 
in secret because they were de;;igm,rl for some particular 
community, i;cx:, or class, to the exclusion of any other, 
or because the natme of the di\.inities to whom tl1ey

under the form of mysteries, and blended themselves, in 
course of time, more or less with the ancient secret 
rite~. Ent in neither case can the mysteries have r:on­
tained philosophic theorems, or doctrines of a purer 
theology essentially tramcendiug the popnlar fait.b.1 
This is sufficiently pro,,ed by the circumstance that the 
m_ysterieH most frequently celebrated were accessible to 
all the Greeks. For even had the prie~ts possessed any 
higher wisdom, how could they have imparted it to 
such a mixed multitude r And what arc we to think of 
a secret philo8ophic Joctrine into which a whole nation 
conld be initiated without a long course of previom in­
~trndion, and without baviDg its faith shaken in the 
traditional mythology? Speaking gon1miJiy, it is not at 
all in keeping with the habits of the ancients to t.ake 
advantage of ceremonial observances for the purpose of 
instructing the people by means of religious discourses. 
A Julian might make the attempt in imitation of 
Christian custom~ ; hut iu classical times there is Dot a 
single instance of it, nor does any truetworthy witness 
ever assert that the mysteries were designed for the in­
struction of tho~e who took p,irt in them. Their parti­
cular end appears far more in those sacred rite8, the 
witnessing of which was tbe pri,•ilege of the initiated 
(Epopt[e); whatever oral communication was combined

and ordinary thoughts of all manki11d.1 Even, however, 
in these two ea88S, the influence seems neither so 
certain nor so considerable as has commonly been 
believed. Jn regard to the unity of God, the theistic 
conception proper is as liUle t,o be found in the mystic 
as in the popular theology. It is impossible to imagine 
how the unity of God in the Jewish or Christian sense 2 
could be illculcated at the feasts of the Eleusinian 
dcit.ies, or of the Cabiri, or of Dionysus. It is a 
different matter, certainly, in respect to the pantheism 
which appears in a fragment of the Orphic theogony,3 
where Zeus is described as the beginning, middle, and 
end of all things, the root of the earth and sky, the 
snbsbnce and essence of air and of fire, the snn and 
moon, male and female; where the sky is called his 
head, the snn and moon are his eyes, the air is his 
breast, the earth his body, the lower world his foot, 
the retber his infallible, royal, omniocient reason. Snch 
a. pa.nthf"ii;m wus not incompatible with polytheism,

THE RELIGIO;..Y OF THE .MYSTERIES. 65 
parts and forces of the world, the different spheres of 
nature and of human life, it is natural that the rela­
tions of these spheres among themselve~, and the 
preponderance of one of them over others, should in 
time be brought to 1ig1it; and, therefore, in all highly 
developed naturnliHtic 1·eligions, we see that kindred 
deities become blended t.ogcther, and the whole poly­
theistic Olympus is resolved into the g-eneml concep­
tion of an all-em bracing divine essence ( 81,Zov ). But 
the Greek religion, becau;,;e of its plastic character, is 
jmt one of those which most resists this fusion of 
definite form$ of deity. In Greece, conseq\1ent.ly, the 
idea of the divine unity was arrived at less l)y way of 
syncretisrn than of criticism; not by blending the 
many gods into one, but by combating the principle of 
polytheism. The Stoics and their succesrnrn were the 
first who rnug·ht to reconcile polytheism with their 
philosophic pantheism, Ly giving a syncrctic interpreta­
tion to polytheism ; the older pantheism. of Xenophanes 
was, on the cont.rary, bitterly and openly hostile to the 
doctrine of the plurality of gods. The pantheism of 
the Orpl1ic poem~, in the fo11n above described, is 
probably much later than the fil'St beginnings of Orphio 
literature. The A,a.Of,,cai are certainly not anterior to 
the Alexa.ndrian Syncreti8m ; nor can the passage re­
specting the theogony, as it now stauds, date from the 
time of Onomacritus, to which Lobeck I assigns the 
greater part of the poem. For this passage was in 
close connection with the story of Phanes-.Ericap1eus, 
devoured by Zeus. Zeus includes all things iu

hiwself, because he swallowed the already created 
world, or l'haues, that he might then produce all 
things from himself, W c shall presently show that 
the swallowing of Phanes 1 originaUy formed no part 
of the Orphic theogony. \Ve must, therefore, in all 
cases distinguish the original text of the Orphic passage 
from the modifications it may aftcrw,tr<ls have under­
gone. As pat't of the original text we may apparently 
claim the verse so frcquent.ly quoted,2 and which is 
probably referred to by Plato : 3 
The idea in this verse, however, and other similar ideas 
to be found in those portions of the Orphic writings 
supposed to be ancient, contain nothing essentially in 
advance of a conception familiar to Greek religion, and 
the gist of which was already expressed by Homer when 
he calls Zeus the l"ather of g0ds and men. 5 The unity 
of the divine element which polytheism itself recog­
nises, was made concrete in Zeus as king of the gods ; 
and so far, all thv.t exists and all that happens i~ ulti­
mately referred to Zeus. This idea may perhaps be 
expressed by calling Zeus the beginning, mi<l<lle, and 
end of all things; but the e:x:pres,fon certainly does not

of all thingo.i There is conseq11e:1tly no evidence that 
the standpoint of the religion,; notion, which concci ve~ 
the gods as persorrn.l being;;, side hy side with the world, 
has here been e'l:cLangcd for that of pbilowphic specu­
lation, which 1·cgru-ds them as representing the general 
esscnco of the universe. 
Tl1e case is somewhat different in regard to t.he 
second point in question, Lclief in immortality. The 
doctrine of metempsychosis seems really to have passed 
from the theology of the mysterie;; into Philosophy. 
Even this doctrine, however, was in all probability 
originally connected, not with all, but only with the 
Bacchic and Orphic mysteries. Those of Eleusis, being 
sacred to the Chthonian d1vinities, were regarded w, 
specially important iu their influence npou man's future 
life. ThC' Homeric hymn to Demeter already speliks of 
the great diiference in the other world between the lots 
of the initiated and uninitiated ; 2 and there are fater 
eulogies of these mysteries, from which it is dear that 
they guaranteed happiness not only in this life, but in 
the life to come.3 There is nothing }1ere, however, to 
imply that the souls of the initiated arc to come to life 
<1gain, or that they are immortal in any other sense 
than was admitted by the ordinary ra.ith of the Greeks.

68 INTRODUCTION. 
In this world wealth and fruitful fields 1 were expected 
from Demeter and her daughters in return for worship 
rendered to them ; and in a simibr wanner, after death, 
the part.akers of the mysteries were assured that they 
should dwell in Hades, in closest proximity to the di­
vinities they had-hon,mred, while the uninitiated were 
threatened with bt:ing cast iuto a marsh.i If these 
rude notion~, at a later period, and among the more 
educated, received a spiritual interpretation,• there is 
no reason to suppose that this was so originally, or 
that the initiated were promised anything in the 
future except the favour af the infernal gods ; the 
popular opinions about Hades rei:nained quite un­
affected by them. Even Pim!ar's celebrated utterances 
carry us no farther. For in saying that the partakers 
of the Eleusinian mysteries know the bf'ginning and 
end of their life/ he does not assert the doctrine of 
transmigration," and though in. other passages this 
doctrine is undoubtedly brought forwa.rd,6 it is still

questionable wliefoer the p0et borrowed it from the 
Elensiniim theology ; and even if he did apply the 
:Elemiuian myths and symhols in this sense, it would not 
certainly follow that such was their original meaning.i 
In the Orphic theology, on the contrary, transmigra­
tion is clearly to be found, and the probabilities are 
very sfrongly against its having come there through 
the medium of the philosophers. SeYeral writers 
mention Pherecydes as the first who taught immor­
tality,2 or more precisely, transmigration ;3 but the 
testimony of Cicero and other later authors is not suffi­
cient, in the absi:;nce of older evidence1
4 to prove thi~ 
statement. Even if we admit the probability that 
Pherccydes spoke of transmigration, the assertion of his 
having been the first to do so rests only t'll the fact 
that no previous writings are known to contain that 
' The re;•iwl of deo.d nat1ire

this does not apply »olely to the

where always rngarded as a punishment and a means 
of improvement, in Pindar it appears as a privilege 
accorded only lo the best, giving them an opportunity 
of earning higher happiness in the islands of the blest, 
imtead of the inferior happiness of Hades. But this 
use of the doctrine presupposes the doctrine itself, and 
according-to the quotaLions from Plato and Pbilo1aus, 
we must assume that Pindar derived it from Lhe Orphic 
mysteries. It is certainly conceivable that it wight 
c:till have reached the mysteries through Pytho.,goreisro, 
whieh must early have been connected with the Orphic 
cult.1 But the most anci(mt testimonies, and the Py­
thagoreans themselves, refor it. solely to the mysteries; 
and it is besides very doubtful whether the Pythagorean 
doctrines could have been p:revaleut iu Thebes, in the 
time of Pindar,2 whereas that city is, on tile other hand, 
known to ha,1 e been an ancient seat of the Bacchic and 
Orphic religion. Lastly, the doctrine of metempsychosis 
is ascribed to Pherccydes, and regarded as anterior to 
Pythagoras, not or,ly by the writers we have quoted, 
but indirectly by all t110se who make Pherecydes the 
teacher of Pythagoras. 3 \:Ve have, therefore, every 
reason to bclieYe that it was taught in the Orphic 
mysteries prior to the date of Pythagoras. According 
to Herodotus, the Orphics obtained it from Egypt :4

bnt this theory either rests upon a mere conjecture 
of his own, or a still more untrustworthy statement of 
the Egyptian prie~ts ; as historical evidence, it is of 
no value whittever. As to the real state of the case, 
history tells us nothing, and no guess tliat we can 
make even approximates to certainty. It is possible 
that Herodotus may be right in the main, and that 
the belief in transmigration was really transplanted 
from Egypt into Greece, eit.1ier directly) or through 
certain intermediaries which cannot precisely be de­
termined. But in that case, we can scarcely agree with 
him in supposing the Greeks to have become acquainted 
with it in t1ie fo·st beginnings of their culture, still less 
can we connect-this acquaintanceship with the mythical 
personalities of Cadmus and Melampus : the most pro­
bable assumption would then be, that the doctrine had 
been introduced into Greece nqt very long before the 
date when we first meet with it in Greek writings~ 
perhaps, therefore, about the seventeenth cf'ntury. 
But it is also conceivable that this belief, the affinity 
of which with Ilindoo and Egyptian doctrines indicates 
an Eastern source, may have originally immigrated 
from the Ea~t with the Greeks themselves, and have 
been at first confinf'd to a narrow cirde, hecoming after­
wards more important and more widely diffused. It

might be urged, in wpport of this view, that similar 
notions have been found among races which never in 
a11y way came under Egyptian influence.1 :Nor can we 
altogether dispute the possibility of different nations, 
withont any historical connection, having arrived at 
the same opinions concerning a future state. Even_ so 
strange a theory as transmigration seems to us may 
tlrns have been reached in several caBes independently 
one of the other. For if the natural desire to escape 
death engenders a univers,tl helief in immortality, a 
bolder fancy, in nations not yet capable of spiritual ab­
straction, might well shape this desire and belief into 
the hope and expectation of a return to earthly life. 2 
l According t.o Harutlut,rn, i,,. 
'.14 sq., the Thracian Getoo believed 
that t.he dPad came to the god ZfLl­

live yettrs they sent a m CTssonger tD 
this god by mMns of a ~pceial hu­
man sam-ifiec, entruqted with c.om­
municalion~ to their departed 
friends. That ihe theory of tr.ms­
migra.tion was invnlved in this 
cannot be d~ducad from the St.'tte­
meut of the Greeks of th~ Hellos­
pout, that Zalmoxis wn.s a schols.r 
of Pyt,h/\garas, who h,1d taught the 
belief in immort.nlily tu the Thra­

the cuswm of 11.nother Thracian

newly bo.rn, and to praise the dead 
as happy; 1,e~&use the former are

e,ec less than the other in regard to

74 INTRODUCTION. 
Hnwever tbis may be, it, appears certain, that 
among the Greeks the doctrine of trarnmigration came 
not from the philosophers to the priests, hut from the 
priests to the philosophers. Meantime it is a question 
whether its philosophic importuncc in antiquity was 
v"'ry great. It is found, indeed, with Pythagoras and 
Lis school, and Empedodes is in this respect allied with 
them; a higher life after death is dso spoken of by 
IIemcleitus. But none of these philosophers brought 
the doctrine into such a conucction with their scientific 
tJrnories as to make it an essentfal constituent of their 
philosophie syi;tem: it stands with them all for a self­
dependent dogma s:ide by side with their scientific 
theory, in which no lacuna would be discoverable if it 
were removed, A pl1ilosophic bftsis was first given to 
the hi-'lief in immmtality by Plato; and it wonlrl be 
hard to maintain that he would not have aaived at it 
without the assistance of the myths which he employed 
for its exposition. 
From aJl that }ias now been said, it would appeal' 
that Greek Philosophy in regard to its ori1;in was no 
more indebted to the religion of the mysterifs than to 
the public religion. The view;; of nature which were 
contained i.n the mysteries may have given an impulse 
to thought; the idea that all men need religious con­
secration and purification may have led to deeper s'tudy 
of the moral nature and character of man ; but as 
rlifferent nations, not rne:rely the this there ls hut & step to the 
hPlief in " kingdom c,f the dead, thBury that the same 80U]s which

scientific instruction was not originally contemplated 
in the tales and practices of the mystic cult, any 
philosophic exposition of these presupposed that the 
e:xpu~itor had already attained the philosophic stand­
point; and as the mysteries were after all only made 
up of general perceptions and expcrienct:s accessible to 
everyone, a h-undred other things could really pel"fonn 
for Philosophy the same service that they did. Philo­
sopJ1y did not require the myth of Korc aud Deme~er 
to reveul the alternation of natural condition~, the 
passage from death to life and from life to death; daily 
observation sufficed for the acquisition of thi5 know­
ledge. The neces;;ity of moral purity, and the advan­
tages of piety and virtue, needed not to be proclaimed 
by the glowing descriptions of the priests concerning 
the happincEs of the initiated and the mise"l-y of the 
profane. These conceptions were immediately con­
tained in lhe moral consciousness of the Greeks. 
N eve1tbeless) the mysteries 1-vere by no means wjthout 
importance in reg·ard to Philosophy, as the results of 
our enquiry have shown. But their importance i;; not 
so great, nor their influence so direct, as has often been 
imagined.

other; they grew up ·side hy side, mutually requmng 
and sustaining one another, out of the same natural 
temperament fl.nd under the Rarne favourable conditiorn. 
As the Greek reverenced in his gods the natural and 
moral 01·der of the world, without therefore renouncing 
in regard to them his own value and freedom, so Greek 
morality stands in a happy mean between the l.awle~s 
license of 11~.rbarons and semi-barbarous races and the 
slavish obedience which subjects the peoples of the 
East to the will of another and to a temporal and 
spirit.ual despotism. A strong feeling of liberty, and 
at the same time a rare susceptibility to measure, form, 
and order; a lively sense of community in existence 
and action; a social impulse which made it an absolute 
necessity for the individual to ally himself to others, 
to subordinate him,,elf to the common will, to follow 
the tradition of his family and his country-these 
qualities, -so essential iu the Hellenes, produced in the 
limited area of the Greek states a full, free and 
harmonious life, such as no other nation of antiquity 
can exhibit. The very narrowness of the sphere in 
which their moral perceptions moved was in itself 
favourable to this result. As the individual knew that 
he was free and had a rig·ht to protection only as being 
a citizen of this or that state, and as, in the same way, 
his relation to others was determined by their relation 
to the state to whid1 he belonged, every one from the 
beginning had his problem clearly marked out fo1· him. 
The maintaining and exten8ion of his civil importance, 
the fulfilment of his civil duties, work for the freedom 
and greatness of his people, obedience to the laws,-

these constituted the simple end which the Gre~k 
definitely proposed to himself, and in the pursuit of 
which he was all the less disturbed liecause his glances 
and endeavours seldom strayerl beyond the limits of 
his home, because he excluded the idea of seeking the 
rule of his actions elsewhere than in the laws and 
customs of bis state, bei.:ame he dispensed with ull the 
reflections by which the man of modern tim12s labours 
to reconcile, on the one side, his individual interests 
:rnd natural rights with the interest and law;; of tl1e 
commonwealth, and, on the other, his patriotism with 
the claims of a cc,smopolitan morality and religion. 
V{e cannot, indeed, n'gard this narrow co11ception of 
moral problems as the highest po;:;s1ble conception, nor 
can we conceal from ourselves how closely the dismem­
berment of Greece, the consuming disquiet of its civil 
wars and party strngglcs, not to speak of slavery and 
the neglect of female education, were connected with 
this narrowness ; but our eyes must not therefore be 
closed to the fact that on this soiI and from these 
presuppositions a freedom and culture arose which 
give to the Greeks their unique phwe in history. It is 
easy also to see how deeply .and essentially Philosophy 
was rooted in the freedom and order of the Greek state. 
There was not, indeed, any immediate connection be­
tween them. Philo~ophy in Greece was always the 
private concern of individuals, states only troubled 
themselves about it in so far as they interfered with 
all doctrines morally and politically dangerous ; it 
received no posit.ive encouragement or support from 
cities and princes until a late period, when it had long

passc:d beyond the highest point of its development. 
Nor was public education concerned with philosophy, 
or science of any kind. At Athens, even in the time 
of Pericles, it scarcely indnded the first rudiments of 
what we should ea.II scientific culture ; nothing was 
attempted beyond reading, writing, and a certain 
amount of arithmetic: history, mat}iematics, physics, 
the study of foreign languages, and so forth, were 
altogether ignored. The philosop11er~ themselves, and 
especially the Sophists, were the first to induce certain 
indiyiduals to seflk for wider instruction, which, how­
eYer, was even then restricted almost excJnsively to 
rhetoric. Beaides the above-mentioned elementary 
arts, ordinary education consisted entirely of music and 
gymna8tics ; and mni'>ic was pdmarily concerned, not 
so much with intellectual training as. with proficiency 
in the Homeric and Hesiodic poems, and the popular 
_songs, siogirtg, playing on stringed instruments, and 
dancing. But this education formed complete aml 
vigorous men, and the subsequent discipline of public 
life engendered such self-confidence, demanded such 
an exercise of all the powers, such acute observation 
and intelligent judgment of persons and circumstances, 
above all, such energy and worldly prudence, as must 
neces~arily have borne important fruit to science when­
ever the scientific need arose. That it could not fail 
to arise was certain ; for in the harmonious many­
sidedness of the Greek character, tbc development of 
moral and political reflection catled forth a correspond­
ing and natural development of speculative thought ; 
and not a few of the Greek cities bad attained, by

means of ~ivil liberty, a degree of pro.;perily which 
ensured leisure for sr,ientific activity to some at least 
of their citizens. Although, therefore, in ancient times, 
the political life and education of the Greeks had 
no direct concem with Philosophy; and :ilthough, 
00 the otrwr hand, the earliest P}1ilosophy, a.s a rule, 
neglected ethical aod political questions, yet tl.ie train­
ing of men and the fact that circumstances took the 
form :required for the production nf Philosophy were 
important element~ in its history. Freedom and 
severity of thought were the natural fruits of a free 
and law-directed life; and the sonnd and sterling 
characters which grew up on the cl::i,;sic soil of Greece 
oonld not fail, even in science, to adopt their standpoint 
with decision, and fo maintain it clearly and definitely, 
with foll and unwavering purposo.1 
Lastly, it was one of the chief exccllenceH of Greek 
education that it did not split up human nalure, but, · 
by the even development of all the powers of man, 
soJght to muke of hirn a beantifnl whole, a moral work 
of art. This trait we ma.y venture to connect with the 
fact tJiat Greek science, especially in its commencement, 
chose the path that is indeed generally taken by thought 
in its infancy-the path downward from above ; that it 
did not form a theory of the whole from the aggrega-

the individual from the study of the whole, and at once 
to shape a collective representation from the existing 
fragments of cosmical knowledge; that philosophy in 
Greece preceded tbe particular scicncP.s. 
If we examine somewhat more closely the circum­
stances which cond1tioned the progress of Greek culture 
before the appearance of philosophy, two phenomena 
especially claim our attention : these are the republican 
form of the government, and the ispread of the Greek 
races by colonisation. The centuries which immedi­
ately preceded the earliest. Greek Philosophy, and those 
which part.Iy coincided with it, are the times of the 
legislators and of the tyrants, of the transition to those 
constitutional forms of government on the soil of which 
Greek political life attained ifa highest perfadiun. 
When tbe patriarchal monarchy of the Homeric period, 
in consequence of the Trojan war and the Doric migra­
tion, and through the extinction, disqualificatio!l. or 
banishment of the ancient royal houses, had entirely 
given place to oligarchy, the ru:istocracy became the 
means of spreading freedom and higher culture through­
out the smaller circle of the ruling families. After­
wards when the oppress-iou8 and internal deterioration 
of these families had evoked the resistance of the 
masses, the popular leaders came mostly from the ranks 
of their hitherto masters, and these demagogues almost 
everywhere eYentua1ly became tyrants. But as the 
government by a single person, because of its very 
origin, found ifa chief adversary in the aristocracy, and, 
as a connterpoise, was forced to fall back for support

upon the people, it became itself a means of training 
and educating the people to freedom. The courts of 
the tyrants were centres of art and culture; 1 and when 
their rule was overthrown, whieh generally happened in 
the course of one or two generations, their inheritance 
of power did not revert to the earlier aristocracy, but to 
moderate constitutions founded on :fixed laws. This 
cuurrn of things was as favournble to the scientific as to 
tlie political training of the Greeks. In the efforts and 
struggles of this political movement, all the powers 
which public life brought to science must have been 
aroused and employed, and the feeling of youthful 
liberty imparted tu the spirit of the Greek people a 
stimulus which must need~ have affected their specula­
tive activity. Tbus t}1c laying of the foundati.ons of 
the scientific and arti~tic glory of Greece was eagerly 
t:aITicd on side by side with the transformation of her 
political circurnstanct'~ ; a connection of phenomena 
which is very striking, and which shows that among the 
Gn!eks, as among all healthy natioua, culture has been 
ti1e fruit of liberty. 
This general revolution w·as effected more quickly 
in the colonies than in the mother country ; and the 
existence of these colonie~ was of the highest importance 
in regard to it. During the 500 years which elapsed 
between the Doric conquests and the rise of Greek 
I>hilosophy, the Greek races had spread themselves, by 
means of organis,t!d emigration, un all sides. The islands

In a people so ricbly endowed as the Greeks, and so 
eminl:'nUy favomed by circumstances in regard to their 
intellectual development, reflection must soon have 
been awakened, and attention directed to the pheno­
mena of nature and of human life ; and attempts must 
early have been made, not merely to explain the external 
world iu reference to its origin and causes, but u.lso to 
consider the activities and conditions of mankind from 
more general points of view. This rnflr:ction was not, 
indeed, at first of a specifically scieutific kind, for it 
was not as yet regulaterl by tl10 thought of any general 
interdependence of things according to fixed law. /Cos­
mology, until the time of Thales, and, so far as it allied 
itself with religion, even longer, retained the form of 
a mythological narrative -,J Ethics, until the time of 
Socrates and Plato, that of aphoristic reflection. !The

deuce of nature; imtead of one central theory of human 
life, we find a number of mornl sayings and prudential 
maxims, which, abstracted from various experiences, not 
unfrequently contradicted one another, and, at the best, 
were reduced to no general priuciples and brought into 
no scientific connection with any theory of Luman 
nature. Though -it would be a mfotake to overlook this 
distinction, and to place either the mythic cosmologists 
or the gnomic poets in the number of the philosophers,! 
as has been done by some writers, both ancient and 
modern, yet we ought not, on the other hand, to under­
rate the importance of these early attempts, for they 
were at least usefol in calling attention to the questions 
which science had first to consider, and in accustoming 
thought to combine particular phenomena under general 
points of view ; and thus a good deal ,vas done towards 
a beginning of science. 
The most ancient record of mythic cosmology 
among the Greeks is the Theogony of Hesio<l. How 
much of this work is derived from still more ancient 
tradition, and how much is invented by the poet him­
self and bis later revisers, cannot now be discovered 
with certainty, nor is this the place to enquirn. It fo

enough for our purpose t-0 observe that the 'l'heog-ony, 
with the roxception of a few subsequent interpolations, 
was undoubtedly known to the earlic~t philosophers in 
its pre3ent form.1 j We find in it nothing approaching 
to a scientific apprehension or solution of the cosmo. 
logical problem. The poet proposes to himself the 
question from which ail cosmogonies and histories of 
creation start, and which, indeed, obvim1sly suggests 
itself even to the most undisciplined intellect,-the 
question as to the origin and causes of all things. 1 But 
in the Theogony this question has not t,he scientific 
importance of an enquiry into the es~ence and reasons 
of phenomena. 'With childlike curiosity the poet asks: 
·who made all thing~ ? and how did He make them ? 
and the answer simply consists in positing as the first 
bi0 ing something that cannot be explained away IJy 
thought, and making the rest originate from this by 
means of some analogy duwn from experience. Now 
expedeuce points out. two kinds of origin. All that 
we see eit.her forms itself naturally, or else is made 
with a design by <lE'finite individuals. In the former 
case production takes place hy the action of the ele­
ments, by growth, or by generat.ion; in the latter,

by the mere expression of our will. All the.~e analogies 
are applied, in the cosmogonies of different natioos, 
to the origin of the world and of the gods ; as a rule, 
several of t-hem at once, according to the nature of 
the objeot in question. To the Greeks the analogy 
of generation must h1we been the most obvious, be­
cause, in accordance with the particular bent of their 
imagination, they had personified the various parts of 
the world as beings akin to humanity, whose origin 
could Le represented in no other way. Iu any case 
th8y must hitve kept to an analogy drawn from nature, 
for Greek thought was too naturalistic and polytheistic 
to maintuio, like the Zoroa~tril!,n and .Judaic religions, 
that everything bad been called into existence hy the 
mere fiat of a creator. In Greek mythology the gods 
themselves were created, awl the deities worshipped by 
the people belong altogether to a younger race of gods; 
there is, therefore, no divinity who can be regarded as 
the first cause of all things, without beginning, a11d who 
possesses absolute power over nature. So in Hesiod it 
is tbe genesis of the gods on which his whole cosmogony 
turns, Most of these genealogies, and the myths con­
nected with them, are nothing more ilian tlic expre,:.sion 
of simple perceptions, or pictlilre-thoughts, of the kind 
that imaginatio11 everywhere produces when the know­
lr,dge of natnre is in its infancy. Erebus and Nyx are 
the parents of .l.Ethe:r and Hemern, for day in its 
brightness is the son of night and darknesE, The earth

water which has been from the beginning in the depths· 
of the earth. Uranus is ema8culated by Cronos, for the 
sun-heat of hiu:vest time puts an end to the fertilising 
d1owers of the sky. Aphrodite springs from the seed 
of Uranus, for the min jn spring awakens the genera­
tive impulse of nature. The Cyclopes, Hecatonchires 
and giants, the Echidna and Typbceus are children of 
G&a; other monsters are the progeny of night or of 
the waters, partly becau~e of their originally physical 
import, partly because what is monstrous cannot spring 
from the bright heavenly gods, but only from darkness 
and the unfathomable deep. The sons of Groa, the 
Titans, were overthrown by the Olympians; for as the 
light of heaven subdues the mists of earth, HO the all­
ordering Deity has bound the \vild forces of nature. 
The thought contained in these myths is very limited; 
whatever in them transcends the most obvious per­
ceptions is the remlt, not of reflection concerning the 
natural causes of things, but of an aot.ivity of fancy 
from which, even when it produces something really 
significant, we mmt be careful not to e.x:pect too much. 
Even in tho combination of these myths, which is 
principally, no doubt, the work of the poet, we fail to 
discover any leading thought of deeper import.' The

88 INTRODUCTION. 
passage in the Thoogony which sounds most like a 
philosophic conception of nature, and was almost the 
only passage employed by the ancient philosophers iu 
that sense/ is the commencement of the poem (v. 116 
sqq.). Chaos was the first to exist, then came Earth 
(with the abyss, or Tartarus) and Eros. Of Chaos were 
born Erebus and Night ; Ea1-th fii·st brought forth of 
herself the sky, the mountains, and the sea; then in 
marriage with tbe sky she produced the progenitors of 
the different families of gods) except the few that are 
derived from Erebus and Night. This representation 
certainly attempts to get at some notion of the world's 
origin, and we may so far consider it as the beginning 
of cosmology among the Greeks ; but as a whole it is 
very crude and imperfect. The poet asks himself what 
was really the first of all things, and he finally abides by 
the Earth as the immovable basis of the Cosmos. Ou:t­
side the Earth was nothing but gloomy night, for the 
luminaries of heaven were not as yet in existence. 
Erebus and Night are therefore as old as the Earth. In 
order that another should be produced from this first one, 
the generative impulse or Eros must have existed from 
the. beginning. Such then are the causes of all thing:,. 
If we exclude all these beings from our thought, there 
remains for th.e imagination only tbe idea of infinite 
space, which at this stage of culture it does not con­
ceive in an a.bstract manner as empty mathematical 
space, but concretely as an immeasurable, waste and 
genealogies, and by which ho eon- the mJhion of Hesiod of Gaisford-
nects them togethel' externally. lfoiz, .ersc 11 S.

formless mass. The first of all things, tlicrefore, i:u 
reality is Chaos. In some such way as this perhaps the 
foregoing theory of the beginning of the world may 
have arisen in the mind of its author.1 It is founded, 
indeed, upon a desire for enquiry, an endeavour to 
attain dear and coherent notions, but the interest 
which rules it is that of the imagination rather than 
that of thouglit. No question is asked concerning tl1e 
esBence and general cause~ of thing~, the problem is 
merely how to learn something about the actual facts 
relating to the primitive condition of the world and to 
its ulterior developments ; ftnd in the solution of thill 
problem, we naturally find that the poet is guided by 
the intuitiom of his imagination, and not by intelli­
gent Teflection. The commencement of the Thcogouy 
is, considering its date, a thoughtful and pregnant 
myth, but it fa not a~ yet a philosophy. 
The next writer aft.er Hesiod of w}wse cosmology we 
know anything at all definite is Pherncydcs of Syros,2

Brandi, ( Gesck. d,r Gr.-Rv'm. Phil.

It is unlikely, ho says, th:i.t the 
poet, had Im invented t.he myth of

ples of the world, or vf Eros as the 
creatiYe principle, wonld hav~ mado

divine army under Ohronos hurls them .into the deep of 
the sea, and keeps possession of hcavcn.1 As to any

Phcrccydes seems to have been silent. 2 This is the

essenLial result to be gat.hered from scatLcre(l fragments 
and traditions respecting· the doctrine of Pherecydes. 
If we compare it with the Hesiodic cosmogony, it, 
undouhtedly eYinces prngl'ess of thought. \Ye find, 
even thus early, a definite attempt to discriminate, on 
the one hand, between the material constituents of the 
universe - the earth, and the atmospheric elements; 
and, on the other, between matter and plastic force. 
In what is said of the conflict of Chronos with Ophi­
oneus, we seem to discern the thought that in the 
attainme.nt of the present cosmical order the forces of 
the aby~s were limited by the influence of the higher 
elements.1 But the expression of all this is mythical, 
and in accordance with the oldet· cosmological mytho­
logy. The world is not formed by the natural op(1ration 
of original matter and forces ; it is ,vrought by Zens 
with the mysterious power of a god; the reduction of 
phenorq.ena to natnral ea.uses, which is the first real 
commencement of Philosophy, is not here to be found. 
It would therefore be of little importance to the 
history of I>hilosophy to know that Pherecydes took 
certain details of his theory, !luch a~ the personality 
of Ophioneus, from Phoonician or Egyptian mytho~ 
logy; but whether important or not, the statement 
cannot be adequately proved by the testimony of so 
untrustworthy a writer as Philo of Byblus; 2 and the 
distinction between the destroying serpent god of 
Pherecydes and the serpent-shaped Agathod;::emon is so

apparent, that we might as well identify the former 
with the serpent form of Abriman, or even, like Origen 
(loc. cit.), with the serpent of the Mosaic paradiRe, if so 
obvious, and among the Greeks so common, a symbol 
required a foreign derivation to account for it. The 
impossibility of mfcrring the whole cosmogony of Phe~ 
re0ydes, in its esseutial features,• to tbe Egyptians, wm 
at once appear on an intelligent comparison of his pre­
.rentations with the Egyptian myths.2 The assertions 
of certain later and untrustworthy writers3 as to his

were overthrown by Zens. Traces of this theogony are 
also to be met with elsewhere ;1 !Jut philosophic concep­
tions are as little to be detected in it as in the poems 
of Hesiod. A third Orphic cosmogony 2 places at. t.he 
beginning of cosmical development water and primi­
tive slime, which latter solidifies and forms the earth. 
Froni these two a dragon .irises, winged, and with the 
face of a god: on one side he has the head of a lion, 
and on the other that of a hull. He i~ called by the 
mythologists, Herncles and Chrorws, the never-aging 
one; with him is united Xecessity, or Adrastea ( accord­
ing to Damasciu~, in a hermaphrodite form), who is 
said to be spread abroad incorporeally throughout the 
univerne to its remotest ends. Chronos-Hcraclcs pro~ 
duces a gigantir: cgg,3 which, dividing in the midst, 
forms with its upper half the sl,y, and with its lower, tl1.i

god who bad golden wing,; on his shoulders, hulls' heads 
on his hanncbes, and a huge snake appearing among 
various animal forms on Lis head; this god, described 
by Damascius as incorporeal, is called Protogonos or 
Zeus, and also Pan, as bringing order into all things. 
Here not only iB the symbolism faT more complicated 
than with Endernns, but the tlmnghts, too, arc in 
advance of the cosmogonies we htive been cvnsidering. 
Behind Chronos and Adrastea are the abstract notions 
of time and necessity ; the incorporeality of Adrastea 
and Zeus presupposes a discrimination of i.:orporeal and 
spiri.hml which was unknown even to Philosophy until 
the appearance of Anaxa.goras; the spreading out of 
Adrastea through the univer8e reminds us of the 
Platonic doetrine of the 'W urkl-sonl; and in the con­
eeption of Zeus as Pun we recognise a pantheism, the 
germ of which lay, indeed, from the br,ginning in the 
natura.listic religion of the Greeks, hut which cannot 
be proved by authentic evidence to haYe actually 
existed before the period when the individuality of the 
various gods had been destroyed by religious syn­
cretism, and when Stoicism had done much to spread 
abroad the pantheistic theory of the 1mivl:'r~e; for none 
of the older system~, however pantheistic in tendency, 
had so great or so general an influence. The pantheistic 
clement eomes out still more clearly in the story of the 
birth and swallowing of Phanes 1 (frifm, pp. 104, 106).

If, therefore, this cosmogony, as is usually supposed,1 
was kno-wn to Bellanicus of Lesbos in the middle of 
the fifth century, we must assign many ideas which ap­
peared only in the later Greek Philosophy to an earlier 
period. Lo beck, however (lvc. &it.), and J\Iiiller 2 rightly 
queEt.ion whether such could have been the case. 
Dmnascins hiwself hints at the doubtful source of the 
account he follows ;3 its content bears pretty evident 
internal traces of an after date, and as we certainly 
know that spurious writings of a very late period were 
circulated 4 under the name of the Lesbian logograpber,

104 INTRODUCTION. 
Lobeck considers that we have a more ancient 
Orphic cosmogony in that desig-nated by Damascius 
( c. 123, p. 380) as the usual Orphic theog-ony, or the 
one contained in the rhapsodies, and of which many 
fragmentR and notices I have been preserved. Here 
Cbronos is rep1·escntcd as the first of all existences. I-Te 
brings forth iEt.her and the dark immeasurable abyss, 
or Chaos: from these h(c, theu forms a silver egg, out of 
which, illuminating all things, procetids Phane~, the 
first-born god, called also l\Ietis, Ero8, and Ericapa:-us; 2 
he contains within himself the germs of aH god~, and 
for this reason, as it would appear, is described as hcr­
mapluodite, and endowed wilh various aniwals' heads, 
and other attributes of the kind. I1 banes alone begets 
Rchidna, or Night, and, in marriage ,with l1er, Urm1118 
and G::ea, the progenitors of the intermediate races of 
gods, whose history and genealogy are essentially the 
same as with Hesiod. ·when Zeus atbins sovereignty 
he devours Pliane8, and consequently is himself (as in 
our previous quotation from Orpheus 3) the ideal sum 
( Inbegriff) of all things. After having· thus united all

things in himself, be again puts them forth, producing 
the gods of the last gener:1tion, and forming the world. 
Among the stories of the younger gods /, for the rest of 
which I must re.fer the rea'1er to Lo beck), the most 
striking is that of Dionyws Zaf_,>1.'cns, son of Zeus and 
l'ersephone, who, rent in pieces by the Titans, comes

The: theory that thi::; wlmle theogony dat.es from t.hc 
period 0f Onomacritns and the Pisistrntidre, ~ince the 
time of Lobeck I lia~ found much favour, but I am 
unable to support it. The utterances of ancient authon 
which are supposed to contain allusions to rnch a 
t.hcogony, do not carry us beyond the theogony which 
Eudemns made use oL Its exiotence is first distinctly 
attest.ed in the pHrndo-ATiRtotelian treatise on the 
world/ subsequently thcrdore to the Christian era, or 
at any rntc not, long before it ;3 for, as we ba·ve seen 
(anpm,, p. 6:3 sq.), the passage from tbe Platonic Law~ 
(iv. 715 E) proves notbing, and still less can he dE­
<luced from tbc Aristotelian citation; on which Br:mdis '' 
relies so much. Since Plato in the' Symposium' (178 B) 
does not mention Orpheus among those who assert the 
antiquity of Eros, we may rather indeed suppose t.hat

]06 LYTROlJUCTION. 
the doctrine of this theogony, in regard to Eros-
1~11ane~, was unkn()wn to him ; and since Aristotle's in­
dications, as above noted, only car.respond with the 
thcogony used by Eudemus, we cannot refer them to 
any other. If, however, Plato, Aristotle, and Eudemus 
did not po~sess that representation of the Orphic doc­
trines, which was at a later period in ordinary use, we 
must conclude with Zoega 1 and Preller, 2 that it was 
not in circulation until after their time, I agree like­
wise with Zoega that ,-o learned a mythographer as 
Apollonius3 would scarcely have made Orpheus sing of 
Ophion and Eurynome as the first rulers of the world, 
and Cronos and Rhea as the second, if the Orphic tra­
dition then current had recognised Phanes and the elder 
gods. Even subsequently to this there are still traces 
t() show that Phanes, the illuminating one, the centre 
of the subsequent Orphic cosmogony, was only another 
name for Helios, who, according to the later representa­
tion, wa~· a IDtlCh younger god. 4 Lastly, if we consider 
the story of Pha.ne~, with the description of Zeus that is 
involved in it, with reference to its internal character 
and purpose, we shall fiud that it is impossible to as~igo.

ORPHIC COSM.OGO~YIES. 107 
this story to a. very ear]y period. Not only do we dearly 
discover in it tlmt pantheism of which we have already 
spoken,1 but the story can only be accounted for by a 
desire to reconcile the later iuterprctation, according to 
which Zeus is the ideal sum of all things, and the unity 
of the world, with the mythological tradition whicl1 
represents him as the progenitor of the last generation 
of gods. To this end the Hesiodic myth of the swal­
lowing of 11fotis by Zeus (in its origin most likely a 
rude symbolical ex:pression for the intelligent nature of 
the god) is introduced, Metis being combined with 
the Helios-Dionysus of the earlier Orphic theology, 
with the creative Eros of the cosmogonies, and also 
perhaps with Oriental divinities, to form the personality 
of Phanes. Such an attempt, it is clear, could not 
have been ruade until the period of that religious and 
philosophic syncretism, which from the third century 
before Christ gradually gained ground, and was first 
reduced to a system by the alleg01ical interpretation of 
myths among t}Jc Stoics. 2 To that period therefore we

To sum np, then, the resulb~ of our enquiry, the 
direct-gain which Philosophy has derived from the 
ancient cosmologies appears to be le~s than we may 
have been disposed to believe. Firstly, because the 
conceptions on which they arc founded are so simple 
that tho11ght could well have attained to thE'm without 
any such help, so soon as it began to apply itself to 
the scientific investigation of 'things; and, secondly, 
because these cosmologies in their mythical symholirn1 
are so ambiguous, and intermingled with so many 
fantastic ele,ments, that they afford a very uncertain 
foundation for intelligent Tefledion. It~ therefore, the 
ancient theologians are to be considered the precursors 
of the lat.er physici5ts, their merit, as was asserted at 
the ont~ot of our enquiry, mainly consisted in this: 
that they turned the current of refl("ction towards cos­

E.TJIIC'AL REFLEC:TIOJ•r. 109 
§ V.-Ethiaal .R~/lectio;i. Th~ology w,d A.rdhropology in 
their relrdion to Ethics. 
If the cxteruai world roused the Greeks rn their 
lively feeling for nature to attempt cosmologioal specu­
lation, the life and w,1ys of men must no less have 
occupi(,d the mind of a rn1Hon 80 intelligent and versa­
tile, so full of freedom and capability in practical life. 
It was inevitable, ho1,•eYer, that reflection should fa..ke 
a different course in mga.rd to Et11ics from that which 
it followed in regard to cosmology. The external 
world presents itself even to sensuous perception a8 a 
whole,~a building, the floor of which .is the earth, and 
the roof, the vault of heavEn ; in the moral world, on' 
the contrary, the unpractised glance sees nothing at 
first but a confused mass of individua.ls or small ag­
grcgn.tes moving abont capriciously arnl promiscuously. 
In the one case, atteutiou is chiefly fixed upon the 
cosmos, the grand movements of the hciwenly bodies, 
the varying conditions of the earth, and the influence 
of the seasons,-in short, upon universal and regularly 
recnning phenomena; in the other case, the interest 
centres on personal aclious and experiences. There t.he 
imagination is required to fill up the lacuure in man's 
knowledge of nature hy means of cosmological inven­
tions; here we require the understanding to set rules 
for practical conduct in spi:.cific ca~es. "\Vhile therefore, 
cosrnologica:l reflection is from the outset employed 
upon the whole, aml seeb to elucidate its origin, 
ethic:al rdlcctiou restricts itself to particular observa­
tions and rules of life, which a.re indeed founded on a

ciples; ti,m] are only connected with more universal 
considerations respecting the lot of man, the future 
de,,tiny of the sou], and the Divine government, in the 
indeterminate aud imaginative mode of religions pre-­
~cntation. Ethical rnflection fa therefore much more 
barren than cosmological; starting from a sound and 
intelligent observation of what is real, it has certainly 
contributed not a little to the formal exercise of thought ; 
but having ari~1-m from a practical rather than a scien­
tific intereHt, and being concerned rather with particu­
lar caRCR than with general laws and the essential nature 
of moral action,--from a material point of view its 
influence on philosophic enquiry has bren far less im­
mediate than that of tl1e old cosmology. The pre­
Socratic N,,ture-PMlosophy was directly connected 
with cosmology, but it was onl_y in the sequel that 
there arose a ~cientific moral Philosophy, as the philo­
sopliic counterpart of popular wisdom. 
Among the writings which show the growth of 
this ethical reflection, the Homeric poems must first 
he mentioned. The great moral importance of these 
poems rests, however, far less on the maxims and moral 
observations which occasional1yappear in them, than on 
the character9 and events which tl1ey depict. The tem­
pestuous force of Achilles, the self-forgetful love of the 
hero for his dead friend, his humanity to the suppliant 
Priam, Rector's courage iii death, Agamemnon's kingly 
presence, the ripe wisdom of Kest~r, the inexhaustible

conscious of the end it is pursuing. 
Hesiod's rules of life and moral obrnrvat.i.ons are 
of a similar character; but it mmt be regarded us some 
approximation to the modes of scientific reflection, that 
he utten; his thoughts on human life, not merely in­
cidentally in the course of an epic narration, bi.:.t in a 
didactic poem designed for thi.s express purpose. In 
other respects, even apart from the economic directions, 
and the .-arious snperstitiom prescripts, which occupy 
the second part of the ' \Yorks and Days,' the thoughts 
are as incoherent, and as much derived from single 
ei:periences, as the maxims in the Howcric diHcournes.

crime, on the contrary, will be punished by the gods.1 
He recommends frugality, diligence and contentment, 
and warmly rebukes the opposite faults; 2 he says it 
is better to keep the toilsome path of virtue than to 
follow the more attractive road of vice; 3 he couusels 
prudence in business, friendliuess to neighbours, courtesy 
to all who are courteous to us.4 He complaim of the 
troubles of life, the cause of which he seeks, like t.he 
mythologists, in wrong done to the gods by the pride 
and presumption of men." In the account of the five 
ages of the world,6 he describes (it may be under the 
influence of historical reminiscences 7 ) the gradual de­
terioration of man and his circumstances. Though in 
this Hcsiod deparls considerablJ, in many respects, from 
the spirit of the Homeric poems, yet the stage attained 
by moral reflection is in both ca~es es.sentially the 
same. But in Hesiod it assumes a more independent 
attitude, for which reason only we recognfae in hirni 
rather than in Homer, the precursor of the Gnomic 
poets.

the numerous poems written in the next three centu­
ries. Very few of such fragments as we possess carry 
us beyond the beginning of the seventh century, and 
these contain scarcely anything relevant to our present 
enquiry. Even from the fragments of the seventh 
century we can glean but very little. i.v e may listen, 
indeed, to Tyrbens, 1 exalting courage in battle, and 
death for one's country; or describing the disgrace of 
the coward and the unhappiness of the conquered; we 
get from Arc11ilochus 2 (Fr. 8, 12-14, 51, 60, 65), from 
Simonides of Amorgos 3 (Fr. I sqq.), from Mimnermus 4 
(Fr. 2 et passirn), complaints of the transitoriness of 
youth, the burdens of old age, the uncertainty of the 
future, the fickleness of men; and, at the same time, 
exhortations to limit our desires, to bear our fate man­
fnlly, to commit the rc8ults of our actions to the gods, 
to be moderate both in sorrow and in joy. we find in 
S,ippho 5 gnomic sentences, such as these: 'The beau­
tiful is also good, the good is also beautiful' (Fr. 102); 
'·w e;;lth without virtue does not profit, but in their 
union lies the acme of happiness.' Nor must we omit 
to mention in this connection Simonides' elaborate 
satire on women (Fr. 6). On the whole, however, the 
older lyricists, as also tl1e great poets in the end of the 
SP.Venth century, Alca::us and Sappho, and long after 
them Anacreun, seem to have dealt but sparingly in 
such general reflections. It was not until the sixth

of Greek l~hilosophy, that the didactic element in 
poetry appear,; to have again attained greatel' import­
ance. To that period belong the f':rnomic poets ~Solon, 
Phocylides, and Theognis; their sayings, however, even 
irrespective of what we know to be interpolated, are 
mostly of doubtful authenticity. During the first half 
of the sixth centnry JEsop also lived, whose legendary 
form seems at an,y rate to prove that instructive 
fables about animals, in connection with the general 
growth of moral reflection, had then become greatly 
developed and popularised. In all these writers we 
tinrl, as compared with the older poets, an advance 
clearly indicating that thought had ripened by the 
acquisition of more varied experience, and by the ~tudy 
of more complex ;;ituations. The Gnomic poets of the 
sixth century had before their eyes an agitated political 
exii;tcnce, in which the manifold inclinatior.s and pa~­
sions of men found ample scope, hut in which also the 
vanity and evil of immoderate aims and inLempcrate 
conduct bad been demonstrated on a grand scale. 
Their reflections, therefore, are no longer concerned 
merely with the simple affair;; of the household, tbe 
villa.ge, or the ancient monarchy; the condition of man 
a.s to his political circumstances is the prominent and 
determining element even in their general moral pre­
scripts and observations. They heap up lamentations 
over the misery of life, the illusions and instability of 
men, and the vanity qf all human endeavours; but it 
is only to assert the more forcibly that the moral 
problem consists in seeking man's greatest happiness 
in the maintenance of just measure, in the order of

116 INTRODUCTION. 
the commonwealth, in the impartial distribution of 
justice, in the reasonable repression of his desires. 
This tone is already predominant in the elegies ascribed 
to Solon. No mortal, we are there told, is happy, all 
are full of trnnble 1 ( F.r. 14) ; each tliinks to find the 
right, and yet no one knows what will be the result of 
his doings, and no one can escape his destiny (Fr. 12, 
33 sqq., Fr. 18);2 hardly any can be trusted (cf. Fr. 
41 ), none keeps measure in his efforts; the peopie by 
its own injustice destroys the city, which the gods would 
have protected (Fr. 3, 12, 71 sqq.). As opposed to 
these evils, the first necessity is law and order for the 
state, contentment and moderation for the individual; 
not wealth, but virtue, is the highest good; superfluity 
of possessions begets only self-eiraltation ; man cau be 
happy with a moderate amount, and ought in no case 
to draw down upon himself tbe certain punishment of 
God by unrighteous gains.3 The well-being of the 
state depends upon a similar disposition. Lawlessness 
a:uii civil discord are the worst evils, order and law the 
greatest good for a commonwealth ; right. and freedom 
for all, obedience to the government, just distribution 
of honour and influence-these are the points which 
tbe legislator should keep in view, no matter what 
offence he may give by it.4

Vl e meet with the same principles in the few au­
thentic fragments that remain to us of the writings of 
Phocylidos (about 540 ll.c.). Noble descent is of no 
avail to individuals, nor power and greatness to the 
state, unless in the one case wisdom is superadded, and 
in the other order (Fr. 4, 6). )iediocrity is hest; the 
middle rank is the happiest (Fr. 12) ; justice is the 
ideal sum of all virtues.1 With these ideas Theognis 2 
also substantially agrees; but in this writer we find 
sometimes his aristocratic view of politics, and some­
times his dissati:;;faction with his lot (a consequence 
of his own personal and political experiences), brought 
into undue prominence. Brave and trustworthy people 
are rare, Theognis thinks, in the world (v. 77 sqq. 
857 sqq.). l\iistrustful cireum~pection is the more to 
be recommended in our intercourse with our fellow 
men (v. 309, 1163), the harder it is to fathom their 
~cntiments (v. 119 sqq.). Truth, he complains (v. 
1135 sqq. ), and virtue, sincerity and the fear of God 
have deserted the earth; hope alone remains. Vain is 
the attempt to instruct the wicked, instruction will not 
alter them.3 Fate, however, is as unjust as mankind, 
The good and t}ie bad fare alike in the world (v. 37 3 
sqq.); good fortune does more for a man than virtue 
( v. 129, 653) ; foolish conduct often brings happiness, 
and wiRe conduct, misery (v, L,3, 161 sqq.); sons 
suffer for their fathers' crimes ; the criminals them-

selves go unpunished (731 sqq.). Wealth is the only 
thing that men admire ; 1 }1e who is poor, be he never 
so virtuous, remains wretched (137 sqq. 649). The 
best thing for man, therefore, is never to Le born ; the 
ne:x:t best to die a$ soon a;; possible ( 425 sqq. 1013): no 
one is truly happy. But though this sounds very dis­
consola~, Theognis ultimately arrives at the same prac­
tical result as Solon ; not indeed in reference to politic,;, 
for he is a decided aristocrat~the nobly born are with 
him the good; the mas;; of the people, the Lad ( e g. 
v. 31-68, 183 sqq. 893 et passim). His general moral 
standpoint, however, approaches very nearly to tbat of 
Solon. Recause happiness is uncertain, and because 
our lot doe~ not depend upon ournelves, he tells us we 
have all the greater need of patience and courage, of 
equability aud self-posses$ion in good fortune and in 
evil ( 441 sqq. 591 sqq. 657). What is best for wan is 
prudence, what is worst is folly ( 8 95, 11 71 sqq. 1157 
sqq.) ; to guard against arrogance, not to overstep the 
right measure, to keep the golden mean, is the height 
of wisdom (151 sqq. 331, 335, 401, 753, 1103 et 
passim). Here, a philosophic moral principle is of 
course still wanting, for these scattered rules of life are 
not as yet based upon general enquiries concerning the 
essence of moral activity, but the various influences and 
experiences are already beginning to unite, much more 
consciously and definitely than with the older poets, to 
form a uniform and connected theory of huma.n life.

sophern, in the stricter meaning of the term, tliey 
stand on the threshold of Philosophy, a relation which 
tradition has strikingly expressed by distinguishing as 
the wisest of the sowm, to whom the mythic tripod re­
turns after completing its round, the fonnder of the 
first school of Natural Philosophy. 
In order to acquaint ourselves thoroughly with the 
soil from which Greek Philosophy sprang, we have 
still to consider how far the notions of the Greeks ' 
about (fod and huwan nature, before the middle of 
the sixth century, had been altered in the course of 
advancing culture. That some change had occurred 
we may take for granted, for in proportion as the moral 
consciousness is purified and extended, the idea of 
Deity, from which i~ derived the moral law and the woral 
government of the universe, must also become purified 
and extended; and the more man realises his liberty 
and his superiority to other natural exi8tences, the 
more will he be inclined to dfatinguish the spiritual 
element of his own nature in its essence, origin and 
future destiny from the corporeal element. The pro­
gress of moral~ and of ethical reflection was therefore 
of great moment to theology and anthropology ; hut 
their influence was more broadly apparent when Philo­
sophy had attained to an independent development. 
The older poets, snbsequcnt to Homer and Hesiod,. 
in their notions of Deity, do uat e~sentiu1ly transcend 
the standpoint of their predecessors ; we ean only 
discover, by slight indications, that a purer idea of 
God was gradually forming itself, and the presupposed 
plurality of gods more and more giving pla.ce to the

1 conception of Zeus as the rnor_;:i,l ruler of the universe. 
; Under this aspect Archilod;~s celebrates him when he 
says (Fr. 79) that }1c he11olds the works of men, both 
the evil and the good, and even watches over the doings 
of animals ; and the more the poet is convinced that 
fate and fortune order all things, that the mind of man 
changes like the day which Zeus allots to him, that the 
gods raise those that are fallen, and cast down those 
that. stand (Fr. 14, 5·1, n9)-the more earnest are his 
exhortations to commit all things to God. So also 
Terpandcr 1 consccrat.es the :introduction of a hymn 
(Fr. 4) to Zeus, as the beginning and director of all 
fhings ; and the elder Sin1onides sings (Fr. 1) that Zeus 
has in his hand the end of a11 that exists, and orders it 
as he wills. But similar passages are to be found even 
in Homer ; and in this respect the differenee between 
the two poets is, perhaps, only one of degree. SQ!~n 
more decidedly paHseR beyond the older anthropomorphic 
idea of God, when he ( 13, 17 sqq.) says, 'Zeus, indeed, 
watches over all thing·s, and nothing is hidden from 
him, but he is not aroused to anger by individual acts 
as mortals are; when crime has accumulated, puni~h­
ment break::; in like tl1e tempest which sweeps the 
clouds from the sky, and so, sooner or lator, retribution 
overtakes everyone.' He:re t1e-inilucnce of moral re­
flection reacting upon the uotioD of Deity cannot be 
mistaken.2 V{e see the same reflection in Theognis

with a differeut result; for the thought of the gods' 
power and knowledge leads him to doubt their justice. 
• The thoughts of men/ he says, '11rc vain (v. 141, 402); 
the gods bring to pass all things as seemeth them good, 
and vain are all a man's rofforts if the dmmon has 
destined him to adversity. The gods know the mind 
and deeds of Hie just and of the unju.-,t' (v. 887)., 
This consideration is son:ctimes connected (as in v. 
445, 591, 1029 sqq.) with exhortations to resignation~ 
but iu other pl::i.ces the pm1 irreverently accuses Zeus of 
treating good and evil alike, of loading sinners with 
wealth, of condemning the righteous to poveJ1ty, and of 
visiting the sins of fath;,rs on their innocent children.1 
If we may suppose such reflections to have been at. all 
frequent. in those t.irncs, we can the more easily under­
stand that sorue of the ancient philosophers should 
contemporaneously have opposed to the anthropomor­
phic notions of polytheiHm an essentially different 
conception of God. 1'his conception, indeed, could 
only have come from Philosophy; unphilosophio refh,e­
tion did no more than prepare the way for it, without 
actually quitting the ;;oil of the popular faith. 
The same may be said nf anthropology. The history 
of this oi·der of ideas is completely hound up with the 
theories about death and ii future stat.e. The dis­
crimination of soul a:nd body originates in the sensuous

the saying of Achille~ that the life of the poorest la­
bourer is better than dominion over shadows, applies to 
all the rest. But ,1s this privilege is limited to solitary 
cases, and is connected not with moral worth, but with 
Mme arbitrary favour of tbe gods, we can ha.rdly seek 
in it the idea of future retribution. 'I'l1is idea comes 
out, it is true, more strongly in Homer, when he 
speaks of the punishments undergone by souls after 
dea.th; but here again only marked and exceptional 
offences against the gods I incur these extraordinary 
penalties, which, therefore, have rather the character of 
personal revenge; and the future state generally, so far 
as any part of .it, either for g·ood or for evil, goes beyond 
an indistinct and shadowy exist.ence, is determined far 
more by the favour or di$favour of the gods than by 
the merits of mankind. 
A more important conception of the future life 
might be found in the honours accorded to the dead, aud 
the idea of universal moral retribution. From the 
former sprang the belief in dremons, which we first 
meet with in Hesiod.2 1'his origin of da:mons fa 
shown, not only by tbe hero-worship which afl.erward~ 
sprang up, but by the passage in Hesiod 3 which says

that the great chiefs of the heroic times were taken 
after the-il' deat.h to the Islands of the Blc:-t. The 
theory of opposite state8, not ID.erely for individuah, 
bu1-for all the dead, is contained in the doctrine we lately 
con;;idercd of the mystic theologians, that in Hades the­
consecrated one~ live with the gods, the uncon,;ccrated 
are plung-cd in night and a miry swarn11. But this 
notion mnst have acquired a moral significance later 
on ; at first, even wl1en it was not so crudely appre­
hended, it was still only a means uf recommending the 
initiatory rites throngh the nwtive;; of hope and fear. 
Transmigration 1 took its ri;;e more directly from ethical 
considerations ; here it is precisely the thought of moral 
retribution which conneds the present life of man with 
his previous and foturo life. It ::i.ppears, however, that 
this docfa:ine in early t.imei; was confined to a somewhat 
narrow spheTc, and became more widely diffused first 
through the Pythagoreans and then through Plato. 
Even the more general thought on which it is founded, 
the ethical conception of the other world as a state of 
universal retri1mtion, seems to have been slow to Teceivc 
recognition. Pindar, indeed, presupposes this concep­
tion, 2 and in after writ.ors, as in Plato/ it appears as an 
ancient tradition already set aside by the enlightenment 
of their time. In the Lyric poets, on the other hand, 
we find, when they speak of the life beyond, that faey 
still keep in all essential respects to the Homeric repre~ 
sentations. Not only does Anacrf:on mcoil with horror 
from the terrible pit of Hades (Fr. 13 ), but Tyrticrn;

too (9, 3) has no other immortality to set before the 
brnve than that of po::thumons fame i Erinna ( Fr. 1) 
5ays the glory of great deeds is 8ilent with the dead ; 
and Theognis (567 ;;qq. 973 sqq.) encourages himself 
in the enjoyment of life by the reflection that after 
death he will lie dumb, Like a stone, and that in Hades 
there is au end of alt life's pleasures. There is no 
evidence in any Greek poet before Pindar, of the hope 
of a future life. 
Vtle fiud then, as the result of our enqniry up to this 
point, that in Greece, the path of philosophic reflection 
had been in many ways cleared and prepared, before 
the advent of Thales and Pythagoras, but that it had 
never ~,en actually attcmpteu. In the religion, civil 
institution~, and moral conditions of the Greeb, there 
was abundant material, and varied Htirnulus for scien­
tific thought : reflection already began to appropriate 
this material; cm,wogouic theories wern propounded: 
human life was contemplated in its different aspeiits 
from the standpoint of religions faith, of morality, and 
of worldly prudence. Many rules of action were set 
up, and in all these ways the keen observation, open 
miud and clear judgment of the Hellenic race asserted 
and formed themselves. But there was aR yet no at­
tempt to reduce phenomena tu their ultimate ground, 
or to explain them natnrally from a uniform point of 
view from Hie same general causes. The formation 
of the world appears in the co
0
rn10gonie poems as a 
fortuitous event, subject to no law of nature ; and if 
ethical reflection pays more attention to the natural 
connection of causes and effects, on the other hand it

CHAPTER III. 
0'.'1 THE CHARACTER OF GREF.K. PHILOSOPHY, 
I:N seeking to determine the common eharacteristic 
w hicb distinguishes a long series of historical pheno~ 
mena from other series, we are at once encountered by 
this difficulty :~that in the course of the historical 
development all particular traits alter, and that conse­
quently it appears impo!:,i,ible to find any single feature 
wbid1 shall belong to every membct of the whole that 
we want to describe. Sw:h is the case in regard to 
Greek Philosophy. Whether we fi..:.. our attention ou 
the object, method or results of Philosophy, the Greek 
.~ystems display such important differences among 
tbemselves, and such numerous points of contact with 
other sy~Lerns, that, as it would seem, we cannot 1·est 
11pon any one characteristic a~ satisfactory for our 
purpose. The object of Philosophy is in all ages the 
same~Reality as a who}e; but tl1i:i object may be ap­
proa.ched from various ;;ides and treated with ni.ore or 
less comprehensiveness; and the Greek philosophers 
differ in thi~ respect so greatly among themselves, that 
we cannot 6a.y wheTCin consists their common difference 
from others. In like manner, the fo1•m and method 
of Hcicntific procedure have so often altered both in 
Greek and other philosophies, that it seems hardly 
VOL. I. K

130 INTRODUCTIO,Y. 
possible to borrow any characteristic distinction from 
thence. I cannot, at any rate, agree with Fries I in hi~ 
assertion that ancient Philosophy proceeds cpagogically, 
aud modern epistematically; that t,he oue advances from 
facts to abstractions, from the particular to the univer­
sal, the other from the univcr~al, from principle>', to tl1e 
particular. For among· the ancient philosophers, we 
find the pre-Socratics employing almost exclmfrely a 
dogmatic, constructive method ; and the same may he 
said of the Stoics, Epicureans, and, more espel,ially, of 
the N"eo-P1afonists. Even Plato and Aristotle so little 
co11fine themselves to mere induction that they make 
science, in the strict sense of the word, begin with 
the derivation of the conditioned from first principles. 
On the other hand, among the modems, the whole of 
the large and influential empirical school declares the 
Ppagogie ·niethod alone to he legitimate; while mo~t of 
the other schools unito induction with comtruction. 
'l'his distinction, therefore, cannot be carried out. Nor 
can we assent to the obsrrvation of Schleiermacher,2 that 
the intimate relation persistently maintained between 
poetry and philosophy is characteristic of Hellenic, as 
compared with Indian Philosophy, where the two ele­
ments are so blended as to be indistinguishable from 
each other, and with the Philosophy of northern nations, 
whAre they never entirely coincide ; and that as soon 
as the mythologic form loses itself, with Aristotle, the 
higher character of Greek science is likewise lost. The 
last assertion is indeed untrue, for it was Aristotle who 
conceived the problem of science most clearly and defi-

nitely; and of the other philosophArs, not a few were 
quitA independent of the mythological tradition-for 
example, the Ionian physicists, the Eleatics, Atomists, 
and Sophfats, Socrates aud the Socrntic Schoob, Epi­
curm and his swiceBsors, the New Academy, and the 
Sceptics; olhers, with the frcr
0
dorn of a Plato, made 
use of mythology merely as an artistic ornarmmt, or 
sought, like the Stoics and Plotinus, to Rupport it 
by a philosophic interpretation, without allowing their 
philosophic syfitem to be conditioned by it. On the 
other hand, Christian Philosophy was always depen­
dent on positive religion. In the :i\Ii.ddle Ages, thiii 
dependence was far greater than the dependence of 
Philosophy upon Teligion in Greece, and in modern 
times it ha,; certaiuly kcu no le~s great. It may be 
urged that the Christian religion has a different origin 
and a different coutent ; but this is a secondary con­
sideratjon in regard to the general attitude of Philoso­
phy to Religion. In both cases, unscientific notions are 
presupposed by thought without. any previous demon­
stration of their truth. Rnt, in fact., no such decisive·: 
eontrast in scientific procedure is anywhere discoverable 
as would justify us in ascribing one definite method, 
universally and excluRively, to Greek, and another to­
modern Philosophy. As little do the results <m each 
side bear out such a distinction. We find among the 
Greeks, Hylozoistic and Atomistic systems, and these 
are also to be found among the modems ; 'in Plato and 
Arist.otle we see a dualistic idealism opposed to ma­
terialism, and it is this view of the world which has 
become predominant in Christendom ; we see the sen-

suulism of the Stoics and Epicurear1s reproduced in 
English and F1·ench empiricism ; and the scepticism of 
the New Academy in Hume; the pantheism of the 
Eleatics and St.oics may be compared with the doctrine 
of Spinoza; the N eo-Platonic spiritualism with Christian 
myHticisrn and Schelling\, theory of identity ; in many 
respects also with the idealism of Leibnit;r,: even in 
Kant a,nd .Taeobi, in Fichte and Hegel, many analogies 
with Greek doctrines can be shown ; and in the ethics 
of the Chrfotian period there are few propositions which 
have not parallels in the sphere of Greek Philosophy. 
Supposing, however, that in ali cases p::i.rallcls were not 
fort.hcoming, still the features peculiar on the one hand 
to Grnck, and on the other to modern Philosophy, could 
only be regarded as generally distinctive of ew:h, if 
they existed in all the Greek systems, and were absent 
frow all the modern. And of bow many eharnctcristics

no laws except its own, became possible. This Jonnal 
character at once completely distinguishes Greek Philo­
sophy from the systems and rc~earches of the Orientals; 
and it is scarcely necess3.ry to speak of the 'tnatm,ial 
oppos-ition presented by the two methods of conceiving­
the world. 'l'hc Oriental, in regard to nature, is not free, 
and has eonsequently been able neither to explain phe­
nomena logically from thefr natural causes, nor to attain 
liberty in civil life, nor purely human culture. The 
Greek, on the contrary, by virtue of his liberty, can per­
ceive in natme a regular order, :md in human life can 
strive to produce a moralit.y aL once free and bem1tiful. 
The ;,arne characteristic:-: distinguish Greek Philo­
sophy from that of the Chri~tians and Mohammedans 
in the .'.\Iiddle Ages. Here, again, we find no free en­
quiry : science is fettered by a douhle authority-by 
the theologil'al authority of po,:i-Live religion, 1md by 
the philosophical authority of ancient authors who had 
heen the instructms of the Arabians and of the Chris­
tian nations. This dependence upon authority would 
of itself have sufficed to eauw a development of 
thought qirite different from that, of Lhe Greeks, even 
'had the dogmatic content of Christianity and Moham­
medanism borne greater resemblance to the Hellenic 
doctrines than was the case. But what a gulf is them

of this omnipotence, for it is distorted and ruined by 
sin. ·while the Greek, relying on his :reason, seeks to •• 
know the laws of the universe, the Christian flees from 
the eno:rs of reason, which to him is carnal, and 
darkened by sin, to a revelation thA ways and mysteries 
of which he thinks himself all the more bound to 
reverence, the more they clash with reason and the 
natural course of things. '\vnile the Greek endeavour,; 
to attain in human life the fair harmony of spirit and 
nature, which is the distinctive characteristic of Hellenic 
morality ; the ideal of the Christian lies in an asceti­
cism which breaks off all alliance between reason and 
sense : instead of heroes, fighting and enjoying like 
men, he has saints displaying monkish apathy; instead 
of Gods full of senwal de,;ires, sexless angels ; instead 
of a Zeus who authori;;es and indulges in all earthly 
delights-a God who Lccomcs man, in order by his 
death openly and practically to condemn them. So 
deeply rooted an oppoRition between the two theories of 
t.hc world necessitated an equal contrast in the ten~ 
dcncies of Philosophy: the Philosophy of the Chrfotian 
Middle Ages of course turned away from the world and 
human life, as that of the Greeks inclined to them. It 
was, therefore, quite logical aud natural that the oue 
Philosophy should neglect the investigations of nature 
which the otl1er had commenced ; that the one should 
work for heaven, the other for earth; the one for the 
Chnrch, the ot,hcr for the State ; that the science of the 
Middle Ages should lertd to faith in a divine revelation,

virtue which consists in the conformity of human life 
to nature ; tha:t, in short, there should exist between the 
two Philosophies a radical opposition coming to light 
even when they apparently harmr;nfoe, u.nd giving an 
essentially different meaning to the very words of the 
ancients in the mouths of their Chri~tian successors. 
Even the .Mohammedan view of the world is in one re­
spect nearer to the Greek than the Christian is, for in 
the moral sphere it does not assume so hostilo an atti­
tude to man's scnsuons life. The 11ohammedan philo8o­
phers of the Middle Ages bestowe<l also greatfir attention 
on natural research, and restricted themselves less ex­
clmively to theological and theologico-metaphy~ieal 
questions than the Christians. But the Mohammedan 
natiom were wanting in that raJ'e geriius for the jntel­
lcctual treatment and morul ennobling of natural in­
stincts by which the Greek wafl RO favourably distin­
guished from the Oriental, who was careless of form, 
and carried both self-indulgence and. sclf-mortificat.inn 
to excess. The abstract monotheism, too, of the Koran 
JS even more directly opposAd to the deified world of the 
Greeb than tbe Christian docrrine is. The j\foharn­
me<lan Philosophy, therefore, in regard to its general 
tendency, must., like the Christian, be pronounced essen­
tially different from the Greek. In it we miss the free 
outlook upun the actual world, and thcrewit,h the activity 
and independence of thought, so natural to the Grceh ;

Greek vie,v of the wol"ld ; even when it pa~ses beyonu 
the original limits of th~ Hellenic sphere aud prepares 
the tnmsition from the ancient period to the Chri;,tian, 
its essential content C;"Jn only be understood in l'elation 
to the development of tl1e Grnek spirit. Even at that 
period we feel that it, is the abiding influence of 
classic ideas which hinders it from really adopting the 
later Htandpoiut. Conversely, with the modern philo­
sophers, even when :-tt first sight they seem wholly to 
return to the arn:ient mode8 of thought, we can always, 
on closer inspection, detect motive~ and conceptions 
foreign to the ancients. The only qu%tion is, therefore, 
where the~e motives and con<lP.IJtions are ultimately to 
be sought? · 
All human cultmt results from the reciprocal 
action of the inward and the outward, of spont.aneity 
and receptivity, of mind and nature; it» direct.ion is, 
therefore, principally determined by the relation that 
exists between the~e two sides, which relation, as we 
have already sPen, was always more harmonious in the 
Gret'k race than iu any other, by reason of its peculiar 
charnctel' and historica1 conditions. The distinctive 
pecnliarity of the Greeks lies, indeed, in this unbroken 
1mity of the 1-:piritu,11 and the natural, which is at once 
the prerogative and the contining barrier of this classical 
nation, Not that spirit and natme were as yet wholly 
undiscriminated. On the contrary, t.he great. superiority 
of Greek eivifoation, as compared with earlier or con­
trinpnrary civilisations, essentially depends on tbis fact 
-that in the light of tlie Hellenic consciousne;;s there 
(faappears, not only the irrational disorder of primitive

and natural life, but also t.hat fantastic confusion and 
interminglement of the ethical with the physical, which 
we almost everywhere meet with ju the East. The 
Greek attains his independence of the powers of nature 
by the free exercise of his mental and moral activity ; 
transcending meTel y natural ends, he regards the scn~ihlc 
as an instrument and symbol of the spiritual. Thus 
the two spheres are to him separate ; and as the ancient 
gods of nature were overpowereu by the Olympian 
deities, so his own natural state gives place to the 
higher stat,e of a moral culture tlrn.t is free, human, and 
beautiful. But thig discrimination of spirit and natme 
does not as yet involve the theory of radical oppo~ition 
and cont.radiction-thc systematic breach between them 
which was prcpariug in lhe last centuries of tlie ancieut 
wodd, and has beeu so fully aecomplishc<l in the Chris­
tian world. The spirit is always regarded as the higher 
element in comparison with nature; man looks upon 
his free moral activity as the essential aim and content 
of his existence ; he is not satisfied to enjoy in a 
sensuous manner, or to work in servile dependence on 
the will of u.nother; what he doe:i he wjll do freely, for 
himself; the happiness which l1e strives for he will 
attain by the use and dew,lopment of his bodily and 
mental powers, by a ,
0
igomus socfo1 life, by doiJJg his 
share of work for the whole, by the re~pei:t of his fellow 
citize11s; and on this personal capability and freedom is 
founded that proutl ;;elf-,confidence "hich raises tlie 
Helfone so far above all the barbarians. The reasou 1

also a higher content than that of any other aucient

race, is because no other WllS able to rise with such 
freedom above mere nature, or wil.h sueh idea.li1,m to­
rnake sensible existence ,;imply the :mstainer of spiritual. 
If then this unity of spirit with nature were understood 
as a unity without difference, the expres~ion would ill 
serve to characteri8e it. Rightly apprehended, on tlie 
other hand, it c.orrectly exprcsse8 the distinction of the 
Greek world from the Christian :Middle Ag,es and from 
modern times. The Greek rises above the world of 
outward existence and absolute dependence on the forces 
of nature, but he does not on that account hold nature 
to be either impure or not diviirn. On the cont,rary, he 
sees in it the direct manifestation of }iigher powers; 
his very gods are not merely moraJ b~ings, they are at 
the samri time, and originally, powers of nature; they 
have the form of natural existen<'e, they constitute a 
plurality of beings, created, and like unto meni rf>stricted 
in their power of action, having the universal force of 
natnre as eternal chaos before them, and as pitiless 
fate above them; far from denying himself and his 
nature for the sake of the gods, the Greek knows no 
better way of honouring them t.lmn hy the cheerful en­
joyment of life, :u1d the worthy exercise of foe talents 
he has ,1cquirerl in the development of his natural 
powers of body and mind. Accordingly moral ]ife also 
is throughout founded npon na1.ural temperament and 
circumstances. From the standpoint of ancient Greece 
it i8 impos~ililc that :wan ~hould crJ11~ider hi8 natnrc 
corrupt, and himself~ as originally comtitute<l, ;;inful.

and lie radicolly c11anged by a moml new birth; no 
demancl. even for that struggle against sensuality which 
our moral law is accustomed to prescribe even when it is 
no longer based upon positive Chri~tianity. On the con­
t.rary, the natural powers as such are assumed to be good, 
and the natural inclinations as ~uch to be legitimate; 
morality consists, aecording to the truly Greek concep­
t.ion of Aristotle, in guiding these powers to the right 
end, and rrw.intaining these inclinations in right measure 
and balance: virtue is nothing more than the iuteHigeut 
and energetic development of naturn1 endowments, and 
the highcsL law of rnornls is to follow the cnmHe of 
nature freely and rntiom,lly. This standpoint fa not 
a result of reflection, it is not attained by a struggle 
with the opJiosite demand for the ronunc.iat.ion of natme, 
as is the case with tl1e moclerns when they prnfess the 
Harne principbs; it is, therefore, quite untrammelled 
by doubt uu'j 1mccrtainty. To the Greek it appears a:i 
natural and nccessai·y that he should allow sensuality 
it;, rights a~ that h~ ::.houkl contwl it by the exercise of 
will and rcflcetion ; he can regard the matter in no 
(,ther light,, and he therefore pursues his course with 
full security, honestly fediug that he fa justified in so 
doing. But among- the natural presuppositions of free : 
activity must a!Ho be reckoned the social relatio-m in . 
which each individual is placed by his birth. The 
Greek allows these relations an amount of influence 
over his morality, to which in modern times we are not 
accustomed. The tradition of his people is to him i..hC? 
highest moral authority, life in and for the state the 
highest duty, far outweighing all others; beyond the

limits of the national and political community, moral 
obligation is but imperfectly recq_.,'llised; the validity of 
a free vocation determined by personal convict.ion, the 
idea of the right~ and duties of man in the wider sense, 
were not generally acknowledg·ed until the transitional 
period which coincides with the dissolution of the ancient 
Greek standpoint. How far the cla.sclical epoch aud 
view of human life are in this respect removed from 
ours, appears ju the constant confusion of morals with 
politics, in the inferior position of women, especially 
among the Ionian races, in the conception of m,UTiage 
and sexual relations, but above all in the abrupt. opposi­
tion between Greeks and barbarians, and the slavery 
which was connected with it, and was Ho indi~pcmalilc 
au in~titutiuu in ancient states. These shadow-sides of 
Greek life must not be overlooked. In one respect, 
however, things were easier for the Greek than for n". 
i His range of vision, it is true, was more limited, his 
· .. relations were narrower, his mornl principles were less 
pure and strict and universal than Olli'S; but, perhaps, 
on that. very account, his life was the more fiUed to 
form completei harmoniously cultured men and classical 
charri.coors.1 
The classic form of Greek art was also essentially 
conditioned by the mental character we have been de­
scribing. The classic ideal, as Vischer 2 well remarks, 
is the ideal of a people that is moral without. any break

with nature : there is conseqnently in the spiritual con­
knt of its idea.l, and therefore in the expression of that 
ideal, no surplus which cannot be unresi.raincrlly poured 
forth in the form as a who1e. The spiritual is not ap­
prehernle<l as opposed to the sen~.ible phenomenon, but 
in and with it; comequently, the spiritual attains to 
artistic representation only so far as it is capable of 
direct expression in the sensible form. A G-reek work 
of art be:irs the character of simple, satisfied beauty, 
of plastic calm; the idea realises itself in the pheno­
menon, as the soul in the bouy with which it clothes 
it.self by virtue of its crm1.ting force ; there is rrn yet no 
spiritual content which resists this plastic treatment, 
and which could not fiud its adequate and direct repre­
sentation in t.he sensible form. Greek art conscq11e11tly 
only attained to perfection where, from the naturn of the 
subject, no task was proposed to it which could not be com­
plete1y accomplished in the way we have jmt dc.-,cribetl. 
In plastic a.rt, in the epi,:\ in classic architecture, the 
Greeks have remained unrivalled models for all time; 
on the other hand, in music they seem to have been far 
behind the modems; he"ause this art, more Umn auy 
other, by its very nature leads us back from the fugitive 
external elements of tone to the inner region of feeling 
and of subjective mood. For the same reasons their 
painting seems only to have been compaxable with that 
of the modems in respect of drawing. Rven G-reck lyric 
poetry, great. and perfect as it is of its kind, differs no 
less from the more emotional and subjective modern 
lyric poetry than the metrical verse of the ancients from 
the rhymed verse of the modems ; and if, on the one

which this activity has in their content ; in a wol'd, on 
his not Laving arrived at self-criticism. The difference, 
:however, between ancient Philosophy and modem is 
here strikingly and unquestionably displayed. 
This characteristic suggests further points for n,­
flection. So simple a relation to its object was only 
possible to Greek thought, because, as compared with 
modern thought, it started from a much more incom­
plete experieme, a more limited knowledge of nature, 
a less active development of inner life. The greater 
the mass of facts wit,h which we are acq_uainted, the 
more complicated are the problems which have to be 
solved in attempting their ~oientific explanation. The 
more accurately, on the one hand, we have come to in­
vestigate external events in tbcir specific character; the 
more, on the other, has our inner eye become keen for 
introspection, through the intensifying of religious and 
moral life ; i.he more oLU historical knowledge of human 
conditions widens, the leBs possible is it to apply the 
analogies of human spiritual life to natlll"al phenomena, 
and the analogies of the external world to the phewJ-o 
mena of consciousness; to rest satisfied with imperfect 
explanations abstracted from limited and one-sided ex­
perience, or to presuppose the truth of our conceptions 
without accW'ate enquiry. It naturally followed, there­
fore, that the problems with which all Philosophy is 
concerned should in modern times partially change their 
scope and significance. Modern Philosophy begins with 
doubt; in Bacon, with doubt of the previous science;

in Descartes, with doubt of the truth of OW' concep­
tions ge1wrally-absolute doubt. Having this starting­
point, it is forced from the outset to keep steadily in 
view the question of the possihility and conditions of 
knowledge, and for the answering of that question it 
institutes all those enquiries into the origin of our 
conceptions, which at ea.eh new turn that they have 
taken have gained in profundity, in importance, and in 
extent. These enquirj cs were at first remote from 
Greek science, which, firmly believing in the veracity 
of thought, applied itself directly to the search for the 
Real. But even after that faith had been shaken by 
Sophhtic, and the nece1ssity of ft methodical enquiry had 
been asserted by Socrates, this enquiry is still far from 
being the accmate analysis of the intellect undertaken 
by modern Philosophy since Locke and Hume. A1'istotle 
himself, though he describes how conreptions result from 
experience, inve,.;tigates very incompletely the conditions 
on which the correctness of our conceptions depends ; 
and the necessity of a discrimination between their 
objective and subjective constituents never seem~ to 
occur to him. Even the scepticism pm,tcrior to Aristotle 
gave no impube to ll.ny more fundamental aud theoretic 
investigations. The empiricism of the Stoics and the 
sensualism of the Epicurmms were based as little as the 
neo-Platonic and neo-Pythagorean speculation on en­

rec0gnition is wanting of the conditions under which 
~cientific enquiry must be undertaken, there science 
must nccc8sarily itself be wanting in that certainty of 
procedurn ,vhich due xegaru. to those conditionR alone 
can give. Thus we find that the Greek philosophers, 
even t.he greatest aml most careful observers among 
t.hem, have all more or le;,s the failing with which 
philosophers have been so often reprow:hed. They are 
apt to cease their enquiries prematurely, and to found 
gene,al concepts aud principles upon imperfect or in­
sufficiently prmred experiences, which are tlien treated 
as indisputable trnth~ and nrnde the basi~ of farther 
inferences ; to display, in short, that dialectical ex­
dusiveness which if; the result of employing certain 
presentations universally a~sumcd, established by lan­
guage, and recorrunt'uding themselyes by their apparent 
accordance with nu.t.m·f\ without further enquiring into 
their origin and legitimacy, or keeping in view whik 
so employing them th.iir real foundation in fact. 
Modern Philosophy has itself been sufficiently faulty 
in this respeet ; it is humiliating to compare the 
speculative rashlless of many a later philosopher with 
the circumspection displayed by Aristotle in testing the 
theories of others, and in examining· the various points 
of view that arise out of the questions he is discussing. 
But in the general courne of modern science the demand 
for a, strict and exact method has more and more made 
itself felt, and even where the philosophers themselves 
have not adequately responded to this demand, the other 
sciences have afforded them a far greater mass of facts 
and laws empirically established; and further, these

facts have been much more carefully sifted and tested, 
and these laws much more acci.uately determined, than 
was possible at the period of ancient Philm,ophy. This 
higher development of the experimental sciences, which 
distinguishes modem times from antiquit,y, is dosely 
connected with that critical method in which Greek 
Philosophy and Greek science genera11y were so greatly 
deficient. 
'l'he distinction of subjective and objective in onr 
conceptions is nearly allied to the distinction of the 
intellectual and corporeal, of phcnmnena within us and 
phenomena without. Tliis distinction, like the other, 
is generaUy wanting in cle,rrness and p1·ecfaion with the 
ancient philowphcr,i. Anaxagoras, it is true, represents 
spirit as opposed to the material world ; antl in the 
Platonic School this oyiposition is developed t.o its 
fullest extent. NeYertheless, in Greek Philosophy, t_he 
two spl1eres ase constantly overlapping one another. 
On the one hand, natwal phenomena, which theology 
had considered to be immediately derived from beings 
akin fo men, continued to be explained by analogies 
derived from human life. On rnch an analogy were 
based not only the Hylozoism of many ancient physi­
cists, and that belief in the animate natme of the world 
wbicb we find in Plat,o, the Stoics and neo-l'latonids, 
but also t.he teleolog7 which, in most of the philosophic 
schools since. Socrates, has interfered wit}1, and not un­
frequently overpowered, the physical explanation of 
nature. On the other hand, t11e true essence of psychic 
phenomena was al:;o not determined with accuracy; and

contented themselves with such simple materialistic 
explanations as Wt're set up by wauy of the pre-Socratic 
physicists, after them by the Stoics and :Epicureans, 
and also by individual Peripatetics; yet even in the 
spiritualistic psychology of a Plato, au Aristotle, or a 
Plotiuus we arc snrprised to find tba.t the difference 
between con,;ciou~ and uncorn,cious force,; is almost ig­
nored, and that hardly any attempt is made to conceive 
the different sicL=is of lmman nature in their personal 
unity. Hence it was easy to these philosophers to 
explain the t:ioul as compmmdcd of di.;;tinct and radi­
cally heterogeneous elements ; and hence, t.oo, in their 
concept.ions relating to God, the workl-sou1, the spirits 
of the stal's, and similar subjects, the q 11estion of the 
per.,onality of the.~e being~ is generally so little con-
8idered. It wa~ in the Christian period that the feeling 
of the validity and importance of human perwnalit.y 
:6.r~t attained its complete development.; and so it is 
in modern science that we fa,,t find on this point con­
ceptions sufficiently precise to render tho ~onfusion of 
personal and impersonal characteristics so frequently met 
with in ancient philosophy henceforward impossible. 
The difference between Greek ethics and our own has 
been already touched upon; and it need scarcely be said 
that all our vrevious remarks on this subject equally 
a.pply to philosophic ethics. .Much as Philosophy itself 
contributed to transform the old Greek conception of 
moral life into a stricter, more abstract., more general 
morality, the characteristic features of the ancient view 
were in Philosophy only gradually effaced, and werfl 
always more or less present down to the latest period o~

antiquity. Not until aft.er Aristotle wa,; the close union 
of morals with politics, so inherent in the Greeks, dis­
solved ; and down to the time of Plotinus, we can still 
clearly recognise the !Bsthetic treatment of ethics, 
which was alw essentially distinctive of the Hellenic 
spirit. 
The ,;pi.ritual life of the Greeks in the tbonsand 
years that c1apsed between the rise and close of their 
Philosophy certainly underwent gTeat and important 
ehangcs, and Philosophy was itself one of the most 
efficient cause~ by which these changes were brought 
about. As Greek Philosophy represents generally the 
charactn of the Greek Rpirit, it must also reflect the 
transformations which in course of time that spirit has 
undergone ; and the more so, because the greater num­
ber and the most influential of tlie phi1osopliic systems 
belong to the period when the older form of Greek 
spiritual life was gradually melting away ; when the 
human mind was increasingly withdrawing itself from 
the outer world, to be concentrated with exclusive energy 
upon ifoelf~and when the transition from the classic to 
the Christian and modern world was in part preparing, 
and in part already accomplished. For this reason, the 
characteristics which appeared in t.he philosophy of the 
clasRical period cannot be UUCOnditionally ascribed to 
the wbole of Greek Philosophy; yet the early character 
of that Philosophy essentially in.tluenced its entire sub­
sequent cow·se. -we see, indeed, in the whole of its: 
development, the original unity of spirit with nature 
gradually disappearing; hut as long as we continue on 
Hellenic gTound, we never find the abrupt separation .

between them, which was t}1e starting-point of modern 
science. 
In the commencement of Greek Philosophy, it is 
before all things the external world which claims at­
tention. The question ari~es as to its causes ; and the 
answer is attempted without any preliminary enquiry 
into the human faculty of cognition; the reasons of 
phenomena are sought in what is known to us through 
the external perception, or is at any rate analogous to it. 
But, on the other hand, just because as yet no exact 
discrimination is made between the external world and 
the world of consciousness, qualities are ascribed to cor­
poreal forms and :mbstauces, and eff"cfo nre expected 
from them, which could only in truth belong to spiritual 
beings. Such are the characteristics of Greek Philo­
sophy up to the time of Anaxagoras. During this 
period, philosophic interest chiefly confines itself to the 
consideration of nature, and to conjectures respcding 
the reasons of naturul phenomena; tbe facts of con­
sciousness are not yet recognised or investigated as 
special phenomena. 
This Philosophy of nature was opposed by Sophistic, 
which denied man's capacity for the cognition of thing~, 
and directed his attention instead to bis own practical 
aims. But with the advent of Socrates, Philosophy 
again inclined towards a search for the Real, though 
at first this was 110t formulated into a system. The 
lesser Socratic schools, indeed, contented themsAlves 
with the application of knowledge to some one side 
of man's spiritual life, but Philosophy as a whole, far 
from maintaining this subjective view of the Socratic

priuciple, culminated in the vast and comprehensive 
systems of Plato and Aristotle, the greatest achieve­
ments of Greek science. These systems approximate 
ruucb more closely to modern Philowphy, on which 
they have had an important influence, than the pre­
Socratic physics. Xature is with them neither the 
sole nor the principal object of enquiry; side by side 
with physics, rr,etaphysics has a higher, and ethics 
an equal prominence, and the whole is placed on a 
firmer basis by the enquiries concerning the origin 
of knowledge and the 1:onditioo.s of scientific method . 
.Moreover, the unsensuous form is distinguid1e<l from 
the sensible phenomenon, as the essential from the acci­
dental, the eternal from the transitory; only in the 
cognition of this unscnsnous essence-only in pure 
thought-is the highest and purest knowledge to be 
sought. Even in the explanation of nature, preference 
i~ given to the investigation of forms and aims as com­
pared with the knowledge of physical causes; in man, 
the higher part of his nature in its essence and origin 
is discriminated from the sensual part ; and the highest 
problem for man.kind iR accordingly found exc~u~frely 
in the development of bis spiritual life, and above all 
of his knowledge. Althoug·h, however, thA Platonic 
and Aristotelian systems show themselvea thus akin in 
m;my respects to modern systems, yet the peculiar 
stamp of the Greek spirit i8 unmistakably impressed 
on them both, Plato is an idealist, but his idealism is 
not the modern sHbjectiveidealism : he does not hold with 
Fi1:hte, that the objective world is a mere phenomenon 
of consciousness ; he doc1:, not, with Leibniz, place per-

6pient essences at the origin of all things; the ideas 
themselves arc not derived by him from thought, either 
human 01· divine, bnt thought js derived from partici­
p:i.tion .in the ideas. In the ide1;1.s the universal essence 
of things is reduced to plastic forms, which are the 
OQjcct of an intellectnal intuition, in the same way 
that thingR are the objeP-t of the sensuous intuition. 
E\en the Platonic theory of knowledge ha~ not the 
clwrncter of the corresponding enquiries of the mo­
dems. vYith them, the main point is the analysis 
of the subjective activity of cognition ; their attention 
is primarily directed to the deYelopment of knowledge 
in man according to its psychological course and its 
conditions. Plato, on the other hand, keeps almost 
exclusively to the ol!jecti ve nature of our presentations; 
he enquires far less about the manner in which intui­
t.ions and conceptions arise in us, than about the value 
.attaching to them in themselves ; the theory of know-
ledge is therefore with him directly connected with 
metaphysics: the enquiry as to the truth of the pre­
;;entation or conception coincides with that respecting 
the reality of the sensible phenomeuon and of the Idea. 
l'luto, moreover, however low may be his e8timation of 
the phenomenal world in comparison with t,hA idea, is 
fur removed from the prosaic and mechauical modern 
Yicw of nature ; the wo:rld is to hiw the visible god, 
the stars are li\•ing, happy beings, and his whole expla­
nation of nature is dominated by the teleology which 
plays so important a part iu Greek Philosophy posterior 
to Socrates. Though in his ethics he passes beyond the 
ancient Greek standpoint, by -t.hc demand for a philoso-

phic virtue founded on science, and prepares the way] 
for Christian morality by flight from the world of sense ,l 
yet in the doctrine of Eros he maintains the re;;tbetk, 
and in tha instit,utions of his Republic the political 
character of Greek morality in the mo5t decided 
manner; and despite his moral ideafaw, bis ethics do 
not disclaim that inborn Hellenic sen&e of naturalness, 
prciportion, and harmony whieh expres~es itself in his 
successors by t11e principle ofliving according to nature, 
and the theory of goods and of virtue founded on that 
principle. The Greek type, however, comes out most 
clearly in Plato's mode of apprehending the whole 
problem of Philosophy. In his inability to separate 
science from morality and religion, in his conception of 
Philol'ophy as the complete and universal culture of 
mind and character, we clearly recognise the standpoint 
of the Greeks, who made far lc:as distinction between 
the different spheres of life and culture than the mo­
dems, because with them the fundamental opposition 
of spiritual and bodily perfection was much less de­
veloped and insisted on. Even in Aristotle this stand­
point is clearly marked, ::ilthongh, in compari;on with 
·that of Plato, his system looks modern in respect of its 
purely i,ciPntific form, its rigorous conciseness, and its 
hrnad empirical basis. He, too, regards the concep~ 
tions in which thoug·ht sums up the qualities of thingi; 
J'lS objective forms antecedent to our thought; not 
indeed distinct from individual things as to their ex­
istence, bnt as to their essential nature, independent ; 
and in determining the manner in which these forms are 
represented in things, he is guided throughout by the

analogy of arti£tic creation. Althougl1, therefore, he 
bestows much greater attention on physical phenomena 
and their causes than Plato docs, his whole theory of the 
world bears essentially the ~tLme teleologic &sthetic 
character as Plato's. He removes the Divine spirit 
from all living contact with the world, but in his con­
ception of natme as a uniform power working with full 
purpose and activity to an end, the poetic liveliness of 
the old Greek intuition of nature is apparent; and 
when lie attributes to matter as such a desire for form, 
and deduces from that desire all motion and life in the 
corporeal world, W6 are reminded of the Hylozoism which 
was so closely related to the ,·iew of nature we arc 
considering. His notions about the sky and the hea­
venly bodies wl1ich he slian,s with Plato and most of 
the ancients, are also entirely Greek. His ethics alto­
gether belong to the sphere of Hellenic morality. Sen­
rnal instincts are recognised by him as a basis for moral 
action, virtue is the fulfilment of natural activities. 
The sphere of ethic,; is distinguished from that of 
politicti, but the union between them is still very close. 
In politics ifoelf we find all the distinctive feat.mes of 
the Hellenic theory of the state, with its advantages and 
imperfect.ions: on the one hand, the doctrine of man's 
natural vocation for political community, of the moral 
object of the state, of the valuB of a free constitution; 
on the other hand, the justification of slavery Mtd con­
t.empt for manual labonr. 'fhm1, while spirit is still

explanation of nature of modern science; neither the 
strictness and universality of our moral consciousness, 
nor the acknowledgment of material interest which so 
often clo.shcs with it. The oppositions between which 
human life and thought move are less developed, their 
relation is more genial and harmonious, their adjust­
ment easier, though c8rtainly more superficial, than in 
the modern theory of the world, oi:iginating as it does 
from far more comprehemive experiences, more difficult 
struggles, and more complex conditions. 
Not until after the time of Aristotle does the Greek 
spirit hegin to be so gi-eatly estrangell from nature that, 
the classical view of the world disappears, and the way

is being prepared for the Chrbtiau. How greatly this' 
change in it.<J consequences affected also the aspect of 
PhiloBophy, will hereafter he sho\vn. In this period of 
transition, however, it is all tlrn more striking to observe 
that the old Gret-!k standpoint was still sufficiently 
infl.ue1itial to divide the JJhilosophy of that time very 
clearly from om·s. Stoicism no longer carries on any 
ind~pendcnt investigation of nature ; it withdraws itself 
entirely from objective enquiry and substitutes the 
interest of moral subjectivity. Yet it continues to look 
tr;,on nature a~ the thing which is highest and most 
divine; it defends the old religion, inasw.uch as it was 
a wor~hip of the powers of nature; subjection to natural 
law8, life according to nature, is its watchword; natural 
truths ( ef,vrrl1eal livvaia1,) are it8 supn~me authority; and'

the extension of political community to the whole race, 
as an immediate requirement of, human nature, in the 
same manner as the earlier Greeks regarded political 
life. -while in Stoicism man breaks with the outer 
world in order to fOTtify himself ir1 the ent:rgy of his 
inner life against external influences, he yet at the 
same time entirely rests upon the order of the universe, 
spirit feels still too much bound to nature to know 
that it is in its self-conciousness independent of nature. 
But nature, consequently, appea:rs afl if filleJ with spirit, 
and in this direction Stoicism goes so far that the dis­
tinction between ~piritual and corporeal, which Plato 
' and Aristotle so clearly recognised, again disappears, 
. matter becomes directly animate, spirit is represented 
, as a material breath, or as an organising fire; and, on the 
other hand, all human aims and thoughts are transferred 
to nature by the most external teleology possible. 
In Epicureanism the specific character of tbe Greek 
genius is otherwfoe manifested. Hylozoism and teleo­
logy are now abandoned for an entirely mechanical 
explanation of nature; the vindication of popular re­
ligion is exchanged for an enlightened opposition to it, 
and the individual seeks his happiness, not in sub­
mission to the law of the whole, but in the undisturbed 
security of his individual life. But that which is 
according to nature is the }iighest, to the Epicmean as 
to the Stoic ; and if in theory he degrades his external 
nature into a spiritless me<.:hanisw, so much the more 
does he endeavour to establish in human life that 
beautiful harmony of the egoistic and benevolent im­
pulses, of sensuous enjoyment and spiritual activity,

which made the garden of Epicurus the abode of Attic 
refinement and pleasant social intercourse. This form 
of culture is as yet without the polemical asperities 
which are inseparable from modern repei itions of it, on 
account of the contrast it presents to the strictness of 
Chriftian ethics; the jrutification of the sensual element 
appears as a natural presupposition which'. does not 
require any preliminary or particular apology. However 
much then Epicureanism may remind U8 of certain 
modern opinions, U1e difference between that which is 
original and of natural growth, and that which is 
derived and the result of refledion, is unmistakable 
on closer examination. The same may be said of the 
scepticism of this period acl compared with that of 
modern times. Modern scepticism has always some­
thing unsatisfied about it, an inner uncertainty, a secret 
wish to believe that which it is trying to dfoprove. 
Ancient scepticism dispL:tys no such half-heartedness, 
and knows nothing of the hypochondriacal unrest whieh 
Hume himself' so vividly describes; it regards ignorance 
not as a misfortune, but as a natural necessity, in the 
recognition of whieh man becomes calm. Even while 
despairing of knowledge it maintains the attitude of 
compliance with the actual order of things, and from 
this very source evolves the a.Tapaf{a which is almost 
impossible to modern scepticism, governed as it is by 
subjective interests. 2

ancient Greek spirit, and decidedly as it approaches that 
of the Middle Ages, has ifo centre of gravity still in the 
antique world. This is evident, not only from its close 
relation to the heathen religions, the last a.pologist 
for which it would certainly not have become had no 
essential and internal affinity existed between them, but 
also in its philosophic doctrines. Its abstract spiritual­
i~m contrasts, indeed, strong-ly with the naturalism of 
the ancients; but ,ve have only to compare its concep­
tion of nature with that of contemporary Christian 
wl'iters, we need only hear how warmly Plotinus defends 
the majesty of nature against tbe contempt of the 
Gnostics, how keenly l'rodns and Simplicius diRpute 
the Christian doctrine of the creation, in order to see 
in it an offshoot of the Greek spirit. Matter itself is 
bro11ght uearer to mind by the nM-Platonists than by 
t,he majority of modern philosophers, who see in the 
two principles essent,ially separate substances; for the 
neo-Platonfats oppo~ea the theory of a self-dependent 
matter, and explained the corporeal as the rnsult of the 
gradual degradation of the spiritual essence. They 
thus declared the opposition of the two principles to 
be not otiginal and ab::1olnte, but derived and merely 
quantitative. Again, though the neo-Platonic meta­
phyi;ics, especially in their later form, must appear 
to us very abstruse, tbeir origin was similar to that of 
Plato's theory of Ideas; for the properties and causes 
of things are here regarded as absolute, essenti:J1 na.tums, 
over and above the world and man, as objects of an 
intellectual intuition, :Moreover, these essences bear

co-ordinat,e, and thus appear as the metaphysical coun­
terpart of the mythical gods, whom nco.Piatonic alle­
gory itself recognised ia them, recognising also in their 
progressive emanation from the primitive essence the 
analogue of those theogonies with which Greek specu­
lation in the earliest times began. 
To sum up what we have been saying. In the 
Philosophy of the middle ages, spirit as~erts it~elf as 
alien and opposed to nature : in modern Philosophy, it 
strives to regain unity with nature, without, however, 
losing-the deep consci ousncss of the difference between 
the spiritual and the natural : in Greek Philosophy is 
represented that phase of scientific thought in which 
the diHcl'iminatiou aud separation Qf the two fllements 
are developed out of their original equipoise and har­
monious co-exfatence, though this ~cparation was never 
actually accomplished in the Hellenic period. ·while, 
therefore, in Greek, as in modern Philosophy, we find 
both the discrimination and tlw nnion of the spiritual 
and the natural, this is brought about iu each cas~ in a 
different rnauner and by a different connectii.m. Greek 
Philosophy st8.rts from tlmt harmonions rehttion of ~pirit 
to nature in which the disifoguishing characteristic of 
· ancient culture generally consists; step by step, and 
half involuntarily, it sees itself compelled to discrimi­
nate them. l\fodem Philosophy, on the contrary, finds 
this separation already accomplished in the most effec­
tual m,rnner in the middle age,, and only succeeds by 
an effort in discovering the uuity of the two sides.

tel'mines the whole character of these two great phe­
nomena. Greek Philosophy finally results in a dualism, 
which it finds impossible to overcome scientifically; and 
even in its most flourishing period the development of 
this dualism can be traced. Sophisticism breaks with 
simple faith in the veracity of the senses and of 
thought. Socrates breaks with unrefiecting obedience 
to eJ.isting custom. Plato opposes to the empirical 
world an ideal world, but is unable to find in this ideal 
world any explanation of the other; he can only expltdn 
matter as something non-existent, and can only subject 
human life to the idea by the arbitrary measures of 
his State. Even Aristotle keeps pure spirit entirely 
distinct from the world, and thinks that man's reaRon 
is infused h1to him from without. In the les~Pr Socratic 
schools and the post-Aristotelian Philosophy this dualism 
is still more evident. But we have already seen that., 
in spite of thi'l tendem:y, the original presupposition of 
Greek thought asserts itself in decisive traits; and we 
shall find that the true cause of its incapacity to re­
concile these corrlmdictioDs satisfactorily lies in its 
refusal to abandon that presupposition. The nnity of 
~piritual and natural, which Greek thought demands 
and presupposes, iH the direct unbroken unity of the 
classic theory of the world; when that is cancelled, 
there remains to it no possible way of filling up a 
chasm which, according to its own stand-point, caunot 
exist. The Hellenic characfr,r proper is not of course

\YE ha:vc divided Greek Philosophy into three periods, 
of which the second begins with Socrates ancl ends with 
Aristotle. The propriety of this division must now be 
more closely examined. The utility of such a course 
may seem indE>ed doubtful, ·since so eminent a historian 
as Ritter I is of opinion that history it.self recognises no 
sections, and that therefore all divi'sion · of periods is 
only a means of facilitating instruction, a setting up of 
resting µlac:es to take breath; and since even a disciple 
of the Hegelran sch(XJl J declares that the History of 
Philosophy cannot be-wrtt.ten in periods, as the links of 
History consist wholly of personalities and aggregates 
of individuals, Thi,, latter observation is so far true 
that it is impossible to-draw a straight chronological 
line across a series of historical phenomena without 
separating what i8 really united, and linking together 
what is really distinct. For, in regard to chronology, 
the boundaries of successive developments overlap each 
other ; and it is in this that. the whole continuity and 
connection of historic as of natural development con-

sists. The uew form has already appearerl, and has 
begnn to assert itself independently, while the uld form 
is still in existence. 'l'he inference from thfa, however, 
is not that the division into periods is to be altog-cther 
discarded, but only that it must be based upon facts, 
ancl not merely upon chronology. Each period lasts as 
long' as any given historical whole continues to follow 
one and the same dir,ection in its development; when 
this ceases to be the case, a new per,iod begins. How 
long the direct.ion fa to be regarded a8 the Harne must 
he decided, here and everywhere, according to the 
part in which lies the centre of gravity of the whole. 
,vhen from a given whole, a new whole brnnches off, 
its beginnings are to be referred to the subsequent 
period in proportion as they break with the previous 
historical connection, and pn,sent themselves under a 
new and original form. lf any one suppose.,, however, 
that this grouping together of kindred phenomena i,;; 
merely for the convenience of the historian 01· his

dfacus:sions in our first chapter are amply sufficient to 
meet the objection. It surely cannot be considered un­
important, even for the purp@ses of convenience, whern

if this be conceded, it cannot be unimportant in regard 
to the matter itself. If one divbion giYes u~ a clearer

deniable, indeed, that not only dilTerent individuals, but 
als0 different periods, have each a different character, 
and that the development of any gi\·en whole, whether 
great or small, goes on for a time in a definite direction, 
and then changes this direction to strike out some other 
course. It is this unity and diversity of historical 
character to which the periods have to conform; the 
periodic division must represent the internal relation 
vf phenomena at the different epochs, and it is con­
sequently as little d<ipendent on the caprice of the 
historian as the distribution of rivers and mountains on 
that of the geographer, or the deterwiuatiou of uatlUal 
kingdoms on that of the naturali~t. 
What division then shall we adopt in regard to the 
hi~tory of Greek Philosophy? It is clear from our 
second chapter that the commencement of this history 
ought not to he placed earlier than Thales. He was 
the first, as far as we know, who, in speaking of the 
primitive causes of all things, abandoned mythical 
language ;-tl.11Jugh it is tme that the old custom of 
making the hidory of Philosophy begin with Hesiod is 
not even in our days, wholly discarded.' Socrates is 
genemlly considered as the inaugurator of the ne:x.t 
great movement, and for this rca~on the second period 
is usua.lly said to open with him. Some historians, 
however, would bring the first period to a dose before 
the time of Socrates ; for example, Ast, 2 Rixner,3 and 
Brani~s. Others, again, like Hegel, woald prolong it 
beyond him.

Ast and Rixner distinguish in the history of (i-reek 
Philosophy the three periods of Ionian Re,.lism, Italian 
Idealism, and the Attic combination of these two ten­
dencies. Braniss 1 starts with the same fundamental dis­
tinctio·n of Realism and Idealism, only he attributes 
both these tendencies to each of the first two periods. 
According-to him, therefore, Greek thought, like Greek 
life, ~ determined by the original opposition of the 
Ionic and Doric elements. Absorptiou in the objective 
world is the characteristic of the Ionic; absorption in 
self, of the Doric race. In th1o first period, then, this 
oppositioll develops itself in two parallel directions of 
Philosophy, the one realistic, tl1e oilier idealistic; in 
the second, this opposition is cancelled, and lost in 
the consciousness of the uniYersal spirit; and in the 
third, the spirit, deprived of its content through So­
phistic, seeks in itself a new and more la~ting content. 
According· to Braniss1 tlrnrefore, there are three periods 
of Greek Philosophy. The first, beginning with Thales 
and Phcrccydcs, is further represented on the one side 
by Ana.xirnander, Ana.ximenes, and Herncleitus; and on 
the other by Pythagoras, Xenophanes, and Parmenidcs; 
a Doric antitbe~is being opposed at each stage of this 
period to the Ionic thesis; £n:1lly, the results of the 
previous development arc summed up in a harmonious 
manner by the Ionian Diogelles and the Dorian Empe­
docles. It is recognised that Becoming presupposes 
Being, that Being expands itself into Becoming, that 
the inner and outer, form and matter: ullite iu the con-
8ciousncss of the universal spirit; the percipient spirit

stands over against this univen,al spirit, and has to reflect 
it in itself. Here the second period commences; and in 
]its development there are three moments. By Anaxa­
'goras, spirit is distingnished from the ex:temled object; 
by Democritus, it is opposed to the object as a purely 
subjective principle; by the Sophists, all objel'.tivity is 
placed in the subjective spirit itself; the universal is at 
length completely snpprcsscd, and spiritual life is en­
tirely lost iu the actual sensible presence. Thus thrown 
back upon itself, however, the spirit is forced to define 
its reality in a permanent ma.nner, to enquire what is 
its absolute end, to pass from the sphere of necessity 
into that of liberty, and in the reconciliation of the two 
principles to attain the ultimate end of speculation. 
This is tho commencement of the third period, which 
extends from Socrates to the end of Greek :Philosophy. 
Much may be urged against thjs derivation. In the 
first place, we must qnestion the discrimination of an 
Ionic Realism and a Doric Idealism. \Vhat is here 
called Doric Idealism hi, as we shall prcsontl_y find/ 
neither idealism nor purely Doric. This at qnco de­
stroys the basis of the whole deduction. Ast and 
Rixner, moreover, divide the Ionic and Doric Philo­
sophy into two periods: a division quite unwarrantable, 
since these two philosophies were synchronous, and 
powerfully reacted upon each other. 1t is io some ex­
tent then more correct tu treat them, like Bran.iss, as 
momeufo of one interdependent hii;torical series. But 
we hn,ve no right to divide the serjes, as he does, into 
two parts, and make the difference between them

analogous to that between the Socratic and prP-Socratic 
Philosophy. Neither of the three phenomena assigned 
by Rraniss to his second pcriOLl has this character. 
Atomistic ( even as to dak, hardly later than Anaxa­
goras) is a system of natural Philosophy, as much as 
any other of the earlier systems ; and to the Empedo­
clcan system especia11y (by virtue of a similar attitude 
to the El ea ties) it stands in so close an affinity that we 
cannot po,.isibly pfacc it in a separate period. It. dis­
covers no tendency to regard spirit as purely suqjective, 
~its soh, concern is the explanation of nature. So, 
too, in Anaxagoras we recoguise a Physicist, and a. 
Physicist anterior to Diog-cues, whom Braniss places 
before him. His world-forming mind is primarily a 
physical principle, and he makes no attempt to enlarge 
the sphere of PhilosDphy beyond the accustomed limits. 
There is, therefore, no good ground for making as 
decided a line of demarnation before b im as before 
Socrates. Even Sophistic cannot be sep,uated from 
the systems of the first perioll, as will presently appear. 
The two periods into which Eraniss has divided the 
pre-Socratic PhiloBophy a.re followed by a third, com­
prehending the whole furtbeT course of Philosophy to the 
end of Greek sc1ence. This partition is so rough, and 
takes so little acconnt of the radical differences of the 
later systems, that it would of itself furnish a sufficient 
reason for repudiating the. construction of Braniss. 
On the other hand, however, Hegel goes too far in 
the contrary direction. He considers these differences 
so great that the opposition between the Socral,ic and 
the pre-Socratic schools has only a secondary importance

in comparison with them. Of his three main periods, 
the first extends from Thales to Aristotle, the second 
comprehends all the post-Aristotelian philosophy, with 
the exception of neo-Platonism; the third embraces 
neo-Platonism. The first, he says,1 represents the com­
mencement of pbilornphising thought until its develop­
ment and extension as the totality of Science. After 
the concrete idea has been thus attained, it makes its 
appearance in the second period as forming and per­
fecting itself in oppositions : a one-sided principle is 
carried . out through the whole of the presentation of 
the world; each side developing itself as an extreme, 
and constituting in itself a totality in regard to its 
contrary. This breaking up of science into particular 
system~ results in Stoicism and Epicureani,m. Scep­
ticism, as the negative principle, opposed itself to the 
dogmatism of both. The affirmative is the cancelling 
of this opposition, in the theory of an ideal world, or 
wor}d of thought ; it is the idea developed into a 
totality in neo-Platonism. 'l'he distinction between 
the old naturalistic philosophy and later science is 
brought forward as a ground of cla;,,sification in the 
first period; it is not Socrates, however, who is the 
inang-urator of a new series of development, but the 
Sophists. Philosophy attains in the first part of this

and in the third part, vous developes itself as objective 
thought, as the Idea, into a totality. Socrates, there-. 
foTe, appears only as continuing a movement begun by 
others, not as the inaugurator of a new movement. 
The first thing that strikes us in this division is 
the great disproportion in the content of the three 
periods. VVhile the first is extraordinarily rich in re­
markable personages and phenomena, and includes the 
noblest and most perfect forms of clas~ic philo~ophy, 
the second and thil-d are limited to a few_ systems which 
are unq nestionably infe1·ior in scientific content to 
tho~e of Plato and AristoUe. This at once makes us 
suspect that too much of a heterogeneous character is 
illcluded in this first period. And, in point of fact, 
the difference between the Socratic and p1·e-S0cratic 
philosophy is in no respect leHs than that between the 
post-Aristotelian and the Aristotelian. Soc:-ates not 
only developed a mode of thought already existing; he 
introduced into Philosophy an essentially new principle 
and method. \Vhereus all the 1.nevious Philosophy had 
been immedlately directed to the object,--while the 
question concerning the essence and c11uses of natural 
phenomena had been the main que~tion on which all 
other~ depended,-Socrates fir:st gave utterance to the 
conYictiou that nothing could be known about any 
object until its universal es~mwe, its concept, was 
determined; and that, therefore, the testing of our

Sophie knowlerlge of self-fo the beginning and the 
condition of all true knowledge. Vi'hereas the earlier 
philosophers first arrived at the discrimination of pre­
sentation from knowledge through the consideration 
of things thcmsclvc.;,; he, on the contrary, makes all 
knowledge of things depemlent 011 a right view as to 
the nature of knowledge. With him, consequently, 
there begins a new form of science, Philosophy based 
upon concepts; dialectic takes the place of the earlier 
dogma.tic; and in connection with this, Philosophy 
makeH new and extensive conquests in hitherto unex­
plored domains. Socrates is himself th0 founder of 
Ethi(Js; Plato ~nd Aristotle separate }fotaphysics from 
Physics; the philosophy of nature-until then, the 
whole of philosophy-now becomes a part of the whole; 
a part which Socrates entirely neglects~ on whioh Plato 
bestows hardly any attention, and even Aristotle ranks 
below the ' fir;:t philowphy.' The,m chang·es are so 
penetrating, and so greatly affect the general con­
dition and character of Philosophy, that it certainly 
appears justifiable to begin a new period of its develop­
ment with SocrateE. The only question that might 
arise is whether to make thfo beginning with Socrates, 
or his precur.9ora the Sophists. But althongh the latter

end of the old philosophy of nature, but it is not as 
yet the crea.tion or beginning of a new philosophy ; 
it clcstroys faith in the possibility of knowiug the 
Real, arid therrby discourages thought from the i11-
vestigation of natnrc; but it has no new content to 
offer as a substitute for what it destroys ; it declares 
man in his actions, and in his presentations, to be the 
measure of all thi11gs, but it understands by man, 
merely the individual in all the contingency of his 
opinions and endeavours; not thrc; uniyersal eBscntial 
nature of man, which must be sought out scientifica11y. 
Though it is true, therefore, Umt the Sophists share 
with Socrates the general (lharacter of subjectivity, yet 
they cannot be said to have inaugurated, in the same 
seu,,e that he did, a new scientific tendency. The clowr 
definition of the two stand-points proves them to be 
very distinct. The sul\jectivity of the Sophists is only a 
consequence of that in which their philosophic achieve­
ment ma,inly consisb,-viz., the destruction of the earlier 
dogwatism: in itself this suqjectivity is tbe end of all 
l-'hilo8ophy; it leads to no new knowledge, nor even, 
1ike htor scepticism, to a philosophic temrer of mind ; 
it destroys all philosophic effort, in admitting no other 
criterion than the advautage and caprice of the iudi­
vidual. Sophistic is an indirect prcpamtion,_ not the 
positive foundation of the new system, which wa.s intro­
duced by Socrates. Now it is usual, geuerally spraking, 
to commence a new period where the principle which 
. domiimtes it begins to manifest itself positively with 
c1·eativo energy, and with a definite consciousness of its 
goal. We open such a period in the history of religion

with Christ, and not with the decay of naturalistic re­
ligions and Judaimi ; in Church history, with Luther 
and Zwinglius, not with the Baby1ouian exile, and the 
schism of the Popes; in political history, with the 
French ReYolntion, not wit.h Louis XV. The history 
of Philosophy must follow tl1e same procedure; and, 
accordingly, we must regard Socrates as the first repre­
sentative of that mode of thought, the principle of 
which he was the first to enundate in a poHitive manner, 
and to introduce into actual Ji fe. 
Vi7ith Socrates then the second great period of Greek 
Philosophy begins. On the subject of its legitimate 
extent there is even more difference of opinion than on 
that of its commencement. Some make it end with 
Aristotle,1 others with Zeno, 2 or Carneadcs;" a third 
class of historians, with the first century before Christ ; 4 
while a fourth is disposed to include in it the whole 
course of Greek Philosophy after Socrates, including 
the neo-Platonists.5 In this case, again, our decision 
must depend on the answer to the question, how long 
the same main tendency governed the development of 
Philosophy? In the fir.~t place the close intercon!lection 
of the Socratic, Platonic, and Aristotelian philosophy 
is unmistakeable. Socrates first demanded that all 
knowledge and all moral action should· stal't from 
knowledge of conceptions, and he tried to satisfy this 
demand by means of the epagogic method, which he 
iutrodnced. The same conviction forms the starting-

point of the Jllatonic system; but what in Socrates 
is merely a rule for scientific prpcedme, i;; developed 
by Plato into a metaphy~ical principle. Socrates had 
said: Only the knowledge of tlJe concept is true know­
ledge. Plato says : Only the Being of the concept is 
tt-ue Being, the concept alone is the truly existent. 
But even Arfototle, notwithstanding his opposition to 
the doctrine of Ideas, allows this : he too declares 
the form or concept to he the essence and reality of 
things; pure form, existing for itself; abstract intelli­
gence, restricted to itself-to he the absolutely real. 
He is divided from Plato only by bis theory of the 
relation of the ideal form to the sensible phenomenon, 
and to that which underlies the phenomenon :rn its 
universal substratum-matter. According to Plato, 
the idea fa fH:parated from things, and exists for 
itself; consequently the matter of things, having no 
part in the irlea, is declared by him to be absolutely 
unreal. According to Aristotle, the form is in the 
thing~ of which it is the form ; the mate:ria l element iu 
them must, therefore, be endowed with a capability of 
receiving form; matter is not simply non-Reing, 1mt.

same content., only in different fad1ion~in the one it 
is undeveloped, in the other developed. Decidedly as 
this contrn.dicts the theory of Plato considered in its 
specific cbaracter, and energetically as Aristotle opposed 
his master, yet he is far from rlisagrneing with the uni­
versal presupposition of the Socratic and Platonic philo­
rnphy, viz. the conviction of the necE'ssity of knowledge 
based on concepts, and of the absolute reality of form.

On the contrary, his very reason for discarding the 
rloetrine of Ideas, is that Ideas cannot be substantial 
and truly existent, if they are separated from things. 
Thus far then we ha,,c a continuous rlevelopment of 
one and the same principle ; it is one main fundamental 
intuition which is presented in these three fonns. So­
crates recognises in the conr:ept tbe truth of hnman 
thought and life; Plato, the absolute, substantial rea­
lity; Aristotle not merely the essence, but also the 
forming and moving principle of empirical reality; 
and in all ,ve see the development of the self-same 
thonght. But with the post-Aristotelian schools this 
order of development ceases, and thought takes another 
· direction. The purely scientific intere:;t of l'hilosophy 
give:o place to the practieal; the independent investiga­
tion of natnre ceases, and the centre of grnvity of the 
whole is placed in Ethics : and in proof of this altered 
position, all the post-Aristotcfom schools, so far as they 
have any metaphysical or physical theory, rest upon 
older systems, the doctrines of which they variously 
interpret, but which they profe:,;s to follow in all essen­
tial particulars. It . is no longer the knowledge of 
things as Huch vrith \Vhich the philosopher is ultiurntely 
concerncrl, but the right and satisfactory constitution 
of human life. This is kept in view even in the reli­
gious enquiries to ""hich Philosophy now applies it.Relf

tions is nevertheless determined by that of their Ethics. 
In a similar manner, the question of a criterion of truth 
is answered from a practical point of view by the Stoics 
a1id Epicureans. La8tly, the Sceptics deny all possi­
bility of knowledge, in order to restrict Philosophy 
entire.ly to practical watters. Even this practical philo­
sophy, however, has changed it~ character. The earlier 
combination of Ethics with po1itics has ceased ; in place 
of the commonwealth in which the individual lives for 
the whole, we find the moral ideal of the wise man who 
is self-sufficient, se ff-satisfied, and self-absorbed. The 
introduction of the idea into practical life no longer 
appearn as the highest object. to be attained ; but the 
independence of the individual iu regard tu nature and 
humanity,-apathy, arapa;la, flight from the world of 
sense ; and though the moral conscion~ness, being thus 
indifferent to the outward, gains a freedom and univer­
sality hitherto unknown to it, though the barriers of 
nationality are now first broken dovm, and the equality 
and affinity of all men, the lear1ilig thouglit of cosmo­
politism is recognised, yet on the other hand ,}forality

abstract. ,mbject.ivity, and this so r,ssentially separate;,, it 
from the preceding systems that we have every right 
to conclude the second period of Greek Philosophy with

cannot prove tliat Philosophy as a whole had recAived 
its later bent in the earlier period. In the first place, 
the phenomena which prefigure in this way the after 
philosophy are few· i:1 number, and of comp:uative1y 
secondary impmfance. The systfnns which give the 
meamre of the period and by which the form of Philo­
sophy, generally speaking, was determined, bear quite 
another character. And in the second place, this affinity 
itself, when more closely examined, is less than it 
appears on a superficial glam:e. Sophistic has not the 
same historical significance as the later scepticism ; it 
did not arise out of a general lassitude of scientific 
energy, but primarily out of an aversion to the pre­
vailing-naturalistic p11il0Rophy; and it did not, like 
scepticism, find its positive completion in an unscien­
tific eclecticism or a mystic 8pBculation1 but jn the 
Socratic philosophy of the concept. The Megaric 
philosophers are rather offshoots of the El catics than 
precursors of the sc1c,ptics; their doubts ar<c originally 
directed against sense-knowledge, not against reason­
knowledge. A universal scept.icigm is not reqnired by 
them, uo:r do they aspire to a7apal;{a as the practical 
end of scepticism. Between Aristippus and Rpieurus 
there exists this striking difference: the former makes 
immediate and positive pleasure the highest good, the 
latter absence of pain, as a permanent condition. Aris­
ti.ppus seeks the enjoyment of that which the external 
world offers; :Epicurus i,ceks man's independence in

182 INTRODUCTION. 
is physica1, because it, primarily seeks to explain natural 
phenomena from their natuml causes, without making 
any definite disc1·imination of spfriturtl and corporeal in 
thiPgs, or the cau~es of things; it is a dogmatism, be­
cause it directly pursues the knowledge of the objective, 
,vithout any previous enquiry into the conceptio111 pos­
sibility, and conditions of 1rnow1enge. In Sophistic, 
this attitude of thought to the external world is at 
an end, man's capacity for the knowledge of the real 
fa called in quest.ion, philosophic interest is averted 
from nature, and the necessity of discovering-a higbc'r 
principle of truth on the soil of humarJ consciousness 
makes itRelf felt. Socrates umwers the demand in 
declaring the cognition of the concept the only wri.y to 
true knmvl.,dg·e anrl true virtue; from which Plato 
further concludes, that only pure concepts cau be true 
reality ; he establishes this piinciple" dialeC'tically in 
conflict ,dth ordinary presentative opinion, aud deYe­
lops it in a system emlm1cing Dialedic, Phy:.,ics, and 
Ethics. Finally, Aristotle discovers the concept in the 
phenomena themselves, as their essence anrl. entele~hy, 
carries it in the most comprehen~ive manner into all 
the spheres of the adua1, and establishes the pTin­
ciples of the scientific method on a firm ba~is for after 
times. In plai,e of the former one-sided philosophy of 
nature there thus appears in the scconrl period a philo­
sophy of the coucept, founded by Socru.t;;s and perfected 
by Aristotle. But since the idea is thus opposed to the 
phenomenon, :-since a full essential Being is ascribed to 
the idea, aud ouly an imperfect Being to the pheno­
menon, a dualism arises, which appears indeed more

glaring and frreconcilable in Plato, but which even 
Aristotle is unable to overcome either in principle or 
in result; for he, too, begins with the oppositiou of 
form and material, and ends with that of God and the 
world, of spiritual and sensilJle. Only the spirit in ib 
aLwlutcness, directed to no external object and suf­
ficing to itself, is perfect and infinite; that which is 
,~xternal to it cannot increase this inner perfection or 
"tie otherwi:;e than valueless and indiffer.mt for it. So, 
too, the human spirit ought to seek itB unqualified 
satisfaction in itself, and in its independence of evcry­
t.hing external. Thought in pur.ming this tendency 
withdraws from the object into itself, and the second 
period of Greek Philosophy passes into the t}iird. 
Or to state the same more succinctly. The spirit, 
wt~ might say, is, during the first stage of Greek 
thought, immc.diately present to itself in Lhe natural 
object; in the se~ond it separates itself from the natural 
ol~cct, that it may attain a higher truth in the thought 
of the super-sensible object; and in the third it asserts 
itself in its subjectivity, in opposit.ion to the object, as 
supreme and uncondit.ioned. The stand-point, however, 
of the Greek world is thereby abandoned, while at 
,,he same time no deeper reconciliation of the opposing 
elewentB is possible on Greek soil. Thought being 
thus separated from the actual, loses its content, and 
becomes involved in a contradiction, for it maintains 
subjectivity to be the final and highest form of being, 
;i.nd yet opposes to it the Absolute in unattainable 
transcendency. To this contradiction Greek Philosophy 
ultimately succumbed.

:FouR schools arc usually distinguished in the pre­
Socratic period-the Ionic, the Pythagorean, the 
Eleatic, and the Sophistic. The character and internal 
relation of these schools are dctermiued, partly accord­
ing to the scope, partly according to the spirit of their 
enqmnes. In regard to the former, the distinctive 
peculiarity of the pre-Socratic period is marked in the 
isolation of the three branches which were aftcnvards 
united in Greek Philosophy: by the Ionians, we are 
told, Physics were exclusively developed; by the Pytha­
goreans, Ethics ; by the Eleatics, Dialectic: in Sophistic, 
we are taught to see the decline and fall of tlii~ c:x.­
clmive c:eience, and the indirect preparation for a more 
comprehensive science.I This difference of scientific

of ancient Philosophy, and deriving from the particular

especially of natural phenomena. Aristotle makes th~""'­

in saying that it i:, impossible to maintain, even from 
the stand-point of the ancient thinkers, that Dialectics, 
Phy,-ics and Ethics came into existence togt:lber, and 
were of equal importance contemporaneously, for there 
could hcive been no question of any le:i.ding ethical 
principle until the preponderance of spirit over matter 
had liccn recogni~ed ; nor could Dialectic, as s11ch, have 
been consciously employed, before form in contrast with 
"1?1atter had vindicated its greater affinity to spirit. 
The object of all philosophic investigation, he con­
tinues, in its commencement was nature, and if even 
enquiry was incidentally carried into other spheres, the 
standa1·d which it applied, being originally taken from 
natural science, remained foreign to those Rp11eres. \Ve 
are; therefore, merely importing our own stand-point 
into the history of the car liest philosophic systems, in 
ascribing a dialedic character to one, an ethical 
character to another, a physiological character to a. 
third; in describing this system as materialistic, and 
that as formalistic, while all in truth pnrsue the same 
enrl, only in different way~.1 The whole pre-Socratic 
Philosophy is in its aim and content a pbilosorhy of 
nature, and though ethical or dialectical conceptions 
may appear here and there in it, this never bappelJs

•• tingnished in this reHpP.ct from all the others, that we 
can prop<~rly characterise it as dialectical or ethical. 
This result must at once cause us to mistrust any 
discriminabon of a realistic and an 1deafotic philo­
sophy. True idealism can only exist whcro the spiritual 
is co!lscioudy distinguished from the sensible, and re­
garded as the more primitive of the two. In that sense, 
for example, Plato, Leibniz and Fichte are idealists. 
·where this i~ the case, there always ari~es the necessity 
for making the spiritniil as snch the object of enquiry; 
Dialectic, Psychology, Ethics arc separated from natural 
philosophy. It~ therefore, neither of these science0 
attained a separate development previous to Socrates1 it 
proves that the definite discrimination of the ,;piritual 
from the sensi1ile, and the derivation of the sensible 
from the spiritual-in which philosophic idealism con­
sists-was still alieu to tb-is period_. Neither the Pytha­
g,,reans nor the Eleatics am, in reality, idealists; at 
any rate they are not more so than other philo,mphers, 
who are .assigned to the retilistic divbion. In com­
parison with the older Ionic school, we find, indeed, 
that they attempt to get beyond .the sensilile pheno­
menon ; instead of seeking the essence of all things 
like their predecessors in a. corporeal substratum, the Py­
thagorear1s sought it in NnmtJer, t11e Elcatics in Being 
without forther determination. But the two systems 
do not advance equally far in this direction ; for if the 
Pythagoreans give to Xumher as the universal form of 
the sensible, the ~:;,me position and signiflcance as the 
Eleatics sulisequently to Parmenidcs give to the abstract 
concept of 13eiug, they dop greatly short of the Elcatics

in the abstraction of the qualities of the sensible phe­
nomenon. It would, therefore, be uwre correct to speak 
of three philosophic tendencies instead of two : a real­
istic, an idealistic, and an intermediate tendency. \Ve 
;;Kave really, however, no right to describe the Italian 
philosophers ::s Idealists. For although their first 
principle is, according to our ideas, incorporeal, the 
precise discrimination of spiritual from corporeal is 
with them entirely wanting. Neither the Pythagorean 
Number, nor the Eleatic One, is a spiritnal essence, 
distinct from the sensible, like the Platonic ide,ts; on 
the conhary, these philosophers maintain that sensible 
things arc a00ording to their true essence, numbers; or 
that they are one invariable substa.nce.1 Number and 
Bfling are the substance of the bodies themselves,-the 
matter of which the bodies consist, and for this reason 
they are apprehended se11suous!y. Conceptions of 
number and conceptions af magnitude interpenetrate 
one another with the Pythagoream; numbers become 
something· extend,2d ; and amoug the E!eatics, e,·eu 
Parmenide:1 describes Being as t.he substance which fil.ls 
space. So in the further development of the systems, 
the-i·e is a confusion of spiritual and corporeal. The 
Pythagorcans declare bo<lie:i. to be numbers: but virtue, 
friend~hip and the soul are al~o numbers, or numerical. 
proportions ; nay, the soul itself is regasded as a cor­
poreal thing.2 Similarly, Parmenides says,3 that reason 
l Thfo may be in it.self !L con­
tradiction (as Steinhart points out 
in tliEi !Juli, A;lg. Liicraturz. 184,5,

Ribbing calls it,2 'the principle of idealism,' for it is

Thought, but conversely from the theorem that. Thought 
falls under the conception of Being; in the former 
case only could it be idealistic, in the latter it must be 
considered realistic. Again, when Parmcnide3 connects 
his Physics with his doctrine of Being, he parallel,/ 
the antitbesi:s of Being and non-Being, not with the 
antithesis of spiritual and corporeal, but with tl1at 
of light an.d darkness. Ari~totle asserts that the 
Pythagoreans presuppose, like the other natural philo­
;;ophers, that the sensible world embraces ,111 reality ;3 
he makes them to differ from Plato in that they hold 
nnmherH to be the thing·3 themselves, whereas Plato

it take account of the intermediate position of the 
Pytfotgoreans bclween the lonians anrl the Eleatics.

Doric spirit manifests itself in his mode of life, his 
philosophy seems to betray the influence of the Ionian 
Physics. Empedocle~ was horn, it is true, in a Doric. 
colony; but the language of his poem is that of the 
Ionian epos. The Eleatic School was founded hy an 
Ionian of Asia Yliuor, it received its final development 
in an Ionian settlement, and in the person of one of its 
last great representatives, '\felissus, it returned to Asia 
j)finor.1 There remain, therefore, of pure Dorians, only 
the Pythagoreans, with the exception of the founder 
of the school, andi if we will, Empedocles. It has 
been said that it is not necessary that the philosophers 
of either division shonld belong to it also by birth ; 2 
and this condition certainly ought not to be insisted on 
in the caHc of every individual. Rut it is surely indis­
pensable with regard to each division as 11 whole; all 
their members should be either Doric or Ionic, if not 
Ly birth, at least by cducat.Jon. Instead of this, we 
find mtire than half the so-called Dorian p)iilosophers, 
not only belonging by birth and extraction to the 
Ionian race, but receiving their education from it, 
through national customs, civil institutions, and what 
is especially important, language. Under these cir­
cumstances, differences of tribe are of very secondary 
moment. They rnay have influenced the direction of

In the ulterior development of these two series,

treatment of the Dorians. In the first place, Phere­

perly speaking, a philosopher, still less js he a Doric or 
idealistic philosopher; for whrit-we know of him bears a

and is of doubtful value among the Pythagoreans. Tt is 
true that tbe belief in the transmigration of souls was 
shared by Pherecydes with Pythagoras, but this isolated 
doctrine, whfoh is rather religious than philosophic, 
cannot be taken as decisive for the position of Phere­
cydes in history~ Further, if we connect Xcnophanes 
with Pythagoras, as Parmenides is conneeted with 
Xenophanes, or Anaximenes with Anaximander, we 
ignore the internal difference which exist.s between 
tJie Eleatic ~tand-point and the Pythagorean. It is 
manifestly improper to treat a doctrine which has a 
principle of its own, essentially distinct from the 
Pythagorean principle, and which developed itself in a 
separate school, as a mere eontinuation of Pytha­
gorism. Again, as we shall presently Hhow, to place 
Empedocles excl11sively in the Pythag-orean-Eleatic 
series is to close our eyes to all aspects of the question 
but one. Lastly, what right has Braniss to pass over 
the later development of Pytbagorism accomplished 
by Pbilolaus (1nd Archytas ; and the development of the 
Eleatic doctrine effected by Zeno and !lfofosus, while 
he recognises men like Anaximenes and Diogenes of 
Apollonia, who were in no way more important, as 
representatives of particular stages of -development? 
His scheme is a Procrust1S;an bed for historical pheno­
mena, and the Doric Philosophy suffers doubly. At 
the one end it is prod.need beyond it!s natural propor­
tions, and at the other it is denuded of membm·s which 
are essentially part of it.H gi,owth.

to determine the historical rehtion of the pre-Socratic 
schools. Here, too, the g·eneral principle is the oppo­
sition of realism, or rather materialism, and idealism, 
This opposition developes itself in three sections, each 
of which fa again subdivided into two parts: firnt, the 
opposing elements stand over against one another in 
sharp contrast; and secondly, there arise various at~ 
t.empts to conciliate them, which, however, accomplish 
no real adjustment, but still incline to one or other of 
the two sides. In the first sectiou, the oppositions 
begin to develop thcmsolves~the mathematical idealism 
of the Doric PyUmgoreans confronts the hylozoistic 
materialism of the older Ionians (Tbale:,i, Anaximancler, 
Anaximenes, Hcracleitus and Diogenes), A reconcilia­
tion is next attempted on the idealistic side by the 
Eleatics ; on the materialistic by the physician Elothales 
of Cos, bis son Epic1mrmus and Alcmreon. In the 
second section, the contrasts become more marked ; we 
encounter, on the one hand, pure materialism, in the 
Atomists; on the otheT, pure idealism in t,he later 
Pythagoreans, Hippa~us, <Enopides, Hippo, Ocdlus, 
Timreus, and Archytas. Between these two, we find on 
the ideafotic side the pantheism of Empedocles, on tlrn 
mateTi3Jistic side the dualism of Anaxagoras. In the 
third u.nrl last section both tendencies pushed to excess 
equally lead t.o the destruction of Philosophy through 
the scepticism of the Sophists. Thus one uniform 
scheme is undoubtedly carried through tbe whole pre­
Socratic Philo~ophy, but it is a scheme that searcely 
correspond,:; with the actual order of history. It is

Thie: foTeg-oing discussions have now pnved the way 
for a positive detenni.nation of the character und course 
of philosophic development during our first period. I 
have characterised the Philosophy of that period (irre­
spectively for the present of Sophistic), as a philosophy 
of nature. It is so by virtue of thr, object which oc­
cupies it: not that it limits itself exclusively to nature 
in the narrow€r sense,~that is to say, to the corporNi.l, 
and the forces unconscio11sly working in the corporeal; 
for such a limit of its sphere would necessa.rily presup­
pose a discrimination of spiritual and corporeal which 
does not as yet exist. But it is fo1· the most part 
occupied with external phenomena ; the spiritual, so 
far as that domain is touched, iH regarded from the: 
same point of view as the corporeal ; and consPquently 
there can be no independent development of Etb1cs and 
Dialectic. All reality is incluicrl under the conception 
of Xature, and ia treated as a homogeneous mass, and

IDB THE PRE-SOCRATIC SCHOOLS. 
point of the earliest philosophy, and even when imma­
terial principles are admitted, it is evident that they 
have been attained through reflection on the data fur­
nished by the senses, not through observation of spiritual 
ffe· The Pythagorean doctrine of numbers, for in­
stance, is immediately connected with the perception of 
regularity in the relations of tones, in the distances and 
movements of the heavenly bodies ; and the doctrine of 
Anaxagoras of the vofii: which forms the world has refer­
ence primarily to the wise organfaation of the world, 
and especially to the order of the celestial system. 
Even the Eleatic theses of the unity and unchange­
ableness of Being are not arrived at by opposing the 
spiritual as a higher reality to the sensible pheno­
mena ; but by eliminating from the sensible all that 
seems to involve a contradiction, and by conceiviog the 
corporeal or the plenum in an entirely abstract manner, 
Here too, therefore, it is, generally speaking, nature 
with which Philosophy is concenied. 
To this its object, thought still stands in an imme­
diate relation, and considers the material investigation 
of nature as its first and only problem. The knowledge 
of the objeet is not as yet dependent on the self-know­
ledge of the thinking subject, on a definite conscious­
ness of the nature a11<l conditions of knowing ; on the 
discrimination of scientific cognition and unscientific pre­
sentation. This discrimination is constantly spoken of 
from the time of Heracleitus and Parmenides, but -it 
appears, not as the basis, but only as a consequence of 
the enquiry into the nature of things. Parmenides 
denies the trust.worthiness of the sensuous percept.ion,

because it shows 11s· an'immoveable Being; Empedocles, 
because it makes the union and separation of material 
substances appear as a pi·ocess of becowfog and passing 
away; Democritus and Anaxagoras, because it cannot 
reveal t.he primitive constituents of things. We find 
in these philosophers no definite principles all to the 
nature of knowledge which might serve to regulate 
ol\jective enquiry, in the way that the Socratic demand 
for knowledge based on conceptions probably served 
Plato: and thongh Parmenides and Ernpcdoclcs in 
theh' didactic poems exhort us to the thoughtful con­
sideration of things, and withdrawal from the senses, 
they do so almost always in an exceedingly vague 
manner; and it does not follow because such a discrimi­
nation finds place in their poems, that in their systems 
it may not be the consequence im,tead of the presuppo­
sition of their metaphysic. Although, therefore, their 
metaphysic laid the foundation fox the after develop­
ment of the theory of knowledge, it is not itself, as yet, 
a theory of knowledge. The pre-Socratic Philosophy 
is, as to its form, a dogmatism: thought, fully believing 
in its own veracity, applies itself directly to the object; 
and the objective view of the world first gives rise to 
the propositions concerning the nature of knowledge 
1vhid1 prepare the way for the later Philosophy of con~ 
ceptious. 
If ,ve ask, lastly, what are the philosophic results of 
the first period, we find, as has already been pointed 
out, that the pre-Socratic systems atternpte1. 1:1_?,_lig~u­
rate discrimination between the spirituarand "the cor­

from matter, which they held to be moved and animated 
by its own inherent force. The Pythagoream, substitute 
number for matter; the Elcatics, Being, rega.rded as in­
variable rnity: but neither of them, as we have already 
remarked, distinguished the incorporeal principles as to 
their essential nature, from thn corporeal phenomenon. 
Consequently, the incorporeal principles are themselves 
apprehended materially, and so in man, soul and body, 
ethical and physical, are considered from the same 
points of view. This confusion is particularly striking 
in Heracleitus, for in his oonception of everliving fire 
he directly unites primitive matter with motfre force 
and the law of the universe. The Atomistic philoso­
phy is from the outset direc~ed to a strictly material 
explanatiGo. of Dature, and therefore neither within 
man nor without him does it recognise any immaterial 
element. Even Ernpedocles cannot have apprehended 
his movi:ng forces in a purely intellectual manner, for 
he treats them precisely like the corporeal elements 
with whieh they are mingled in things; so too in man 
the spiritual iDtermiugles with the corporeal ; blood is 
the faculty of thought, Anaxag{)fas was the first to 
teach definitely that the spirit is unmixed with any 
material eleweut ; but in Anaxagoras we reach the 
limit of the ancient Philosophy of Nature. Moreover, 
according to him, the wmld-forming spirit operates 
merely as a force .of uature, and is represented in a half 
sensible form as a more subtle kind of matter. This 
particular example, therefore, cannot affect our previous 
judgment of th-. pre-Socratic Philosophy so far as its 
general and predominant tendency is concerned.

GENERAL CJIARACl'BRISTICS. 201 
All tbcse traits lead us to recognise as the charac­
teristic peculiarity of the first period, a prepondera.nce of 
natural research ove1· introspective reflection ; an absorp~ 
tion with the outer world which prevents thought frow 
bestowing separat.c study on any object besides nature, 
from distinguishing the spiritual from the corporeal in 
an e:x:act and definite manner ; from ~eeking out the 
form and the laws of scientific procedure for themselves. 
Overborne by external iIDpressions, man at first fools 
himself a pttrt of nature, he therefore knows no higher 
problem for his thought than the investigation of 
nature, he applies himself to this problem, impartially 
and directly, without stopping previously to enquire 
into the subjective conditions of knowledge; and even 
when his investigation of nature itself carries him be­
yond the sensible phenomena as snch, yet he does not 
advance beyond nature considered as a whole, to an 
ideal Being, which bas its import and ib; subsistence 
in itself. Behind the sensible phenomena, forces and 
substances are indeed sought which cannot be perceived 
by the senses ; but the effects of these forces are the 
things of nature, the essences not apprehended by 
sense are the substance of the sensible itself, and no­
thing besides ; a spiritual world side by side with the ; 
material world has not yet been discovered. / 
How far this description applies also to Sophistic 
we have already seen. The interest of natural research 
and the belief in the truth of our presentments are 
now at an end, but no new mad to knowledge and higher 
reality is as yet pointed out ; and far from opposing the 
,kingdom of the spirit to natmei the Sophists regard

man himself as a merely sensuous being. Although, 
therefore, the pre-Socratic natural philosophy is 
abolished in Sophistic, Sophistic like its predecessors 
knows of nothing higher than Nature, and has no other 
material to work 1Jll ; the change consists not in oppos­
ing a new form of seience to a previous form, but in 
making use of the existing elements, pttrticularly the 
Ele11tie and IIeracleitean doctrines, to introduce donbt 
into scientific consciousness, and to destroy belief in 
the possibility of knowledge. 
Thus we are compelled, by the results of our in­
vestigation, to bring the three oldest schools of Philo­
sophy-the Ionian, the Pythti.gorean, and the Eleatic­
into a closer corrnection than has hitherto been cus­
tomary. They are not only very near to each other in 
respect to time, but are much more alike in their 
scientific character tban might at first sight be sup­
posed. While they agree with the whole of the early 
Philo~ophy in directing their enquhies to the explana­
tion of nature, this tendency is in their case more 
particularly shown in a search for the substantial 
ground of thing~: in demanding what things are in 
their proper essence, and of what they consist; the 
problem of the explanation of Becoming, and passing 
away, of the movement and multiplicity of phenomena 
is not as yet distinctly grasped. Thales makes all 
things origi11ate and comist in water, Anaximander in 
infinite matter, Ana.:::::imenos in air; the Pythiigoreans 
say that everything is Number; the Eleatics that the All 
is one invariable Being. Now it is true that the Elea­
tics alone, and they only subsequently to Parmenides, 
8/22

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS. 203 
denied movement and Becoming, whereas the Iouians 
and the l'ythagoreans minutely describe the formation 
of the world. But they neither of them propounded 
the question of the possibility of Becoming and of 
dividP,d Being· in this general manner, nor in the esmb­
lishment of their principles uid ihcy attempt particular 
definitions in regard to it. The lonians tell us that the 
primitive matter changes; that from matter, originally 
one, contrary elements were separated and combined in 
various relations to form a world. The Pythagoreans 
say that magnitudes are derived from numbers, and 
from magnitudes, bodies ; but on what this process was 
b<tsed, how it came about that matter was moved and 
transmuted, that numbers produced something other 
than themselves,~they make no scientific attempt to 
explain, \Vhat they seek is not so much to explain 
phenomena from general principles, ns to reduce phe·­
noineua to their first principles. Their scientific in­
terest is concerned rather with the identical e8sence 
of things, the substance of which all things consist, 
than with the multiplicity of t.he phenomena and the 
causes of that multiplicity. When the Eleatics, there­
fore, entirely denied the Becoming- and the }fany they 
merely called in question au unprovcd presupposition 
of their predecessors ; and in apprehending all reality 
as a unity absolutely excluding multiplicity, th~y only • 
carried out more perfectly the tendency of the two) 
older schools. Her:wleitus was the first to sec in 
motion, change, and separation, the fundamental 
quality of the primitive essence; and the polemic of 
Parmenides first occa~ioned Philosop.hy to enquire more

things consist, witl1out expressly seeking· the cause uf

the second mat11ematically, by the third metaphysi~ 
cally; but these differences only show us the gradual 
development of t,he same tendency in a progression from 
the concrete to the abstract ; for number and mathe.­
matical form are a middle term between the sensible 
and pure thought ; and were afterwards regarded, by 
Plato especially, as their proper connecting link.

second of ·which begins with Heracleitus. Between 
this philosopher and his predecessors, he says, there is a 
considerable chronological gap, probably in consequence 
of the intermption occasioned to philosophic pursuits 
by the distnrbances in Ionia. ]foreover, while the 
three most ancient Ionians came from :Miletus, Philo­
sophy now spreads itself geograpbicaUy over a much 
wider sphere. Also, in the content of his philosophy, 
Heracleitus ri8es far above the earlier phy~icists, so -
that he may, perhaps, have derived little from them. 
Ritter,1 too, acknowledges that Heracleitus differs in 
many respects from the older Ionian1:1, and that his 
theory of the universal force of nature places him 
quite ill a separate order from them. Brnnrli.,,2 in 
still closer agreement with Schlciermacher, hold;, that 
with Heracleitus commences a new period in the de­
velopment of the Ionian Philoaophy, to which, besides 
Heracleitus, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Leucippm, De­
mocritus, Diogenes, and Archelans likewise belong; 
all these being distinguished from t.he earlier philo­
sophers by their more scientific attempts to derive the 
multiplicity of particulars from a primitive cause, by 
their more explicit rec::>guition or denial of the dis­
tinction between spirit and matter, as also of a Divinity 
that forms the world ; and by their common endeavour 
to establish the reality of particulars and their varia­
tions in opposition to the doctrine of the Eleatic One. 
These remarks are quite true, and only, perhaps, open to 
quest.ion with regard to Diogenes of Apollonia. But it

200 THE PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY. 
is not cno11g}1 to make this difference the dividing-line 
between two classes of Ionic physiologists ; it is deeply 
rooted in the whole of the pre-Socratic Philosopliy. 
Neither the doctrine of Empcdocles, nor that of Anaxa­
goras, nor that of the Atomists can be explained by the 
development of the Ionian physiology as such ; their 
relation t.o the Eleatics is not the merely IlC{;a.tivc rela­
tion of disallowing the denial of RcalitJ, Becoming, and 
Multiplicity; they powiti,vely learned a good deal from 
· the Eleatic school. They all acknowledge the great 
principle of the system of Parmenides, that there is no 
Becoming or passing away in the strict sense of the 
terms; consequently they aU cxpfa.in phenomena from the 
combination and separation of material elements, and 
they in part borrow their concept of Being directly from 
the Eleatic met..'1physics. They ought, therefore, to be 
placed after the Eleatic school, and not before it.. In 
regard to Heracleitus, it is less certain whet.her, or how 
far, he concerned him~elf with the beginnings of the 
Eleatie Philosophy; in point of fact, however, his posi­
tion is not only entirely antagonistic to the Eleaticll, hut 
be may generally be said to enter upon a new course 
altoget.her divergent from that hitherto followed. In 
denying all :fixednes!l in the constitution of things, and 
recognising the law of their variability as the only per­
manent element in them, he declares the futility of the 
previous science which ma.de matter and substance the 
chief object of enquiry; and assP.1{s the investigation 
of the causes and laws which determine Becoming and 
Change to be the hue problem of Philosophy. Thus, 
although the question as to the essence and material

EARLIER AND LATER PIIYSIC1ST8. 207 
substance of things was not overlooked by Hem­
cleitus and his followers, any more tban the account of 
the formation of the world was omitted by the Ionians 
and Pythagoreans, the two elements stand with each of 
them in a very different relation. In the 011e case, ths 
enquiry as to the subsbmce of things is the main poLnt, 
and the not.ions abo_ut their origin are dependent upon 
the answer given to this questiou; in the other, the 
chief question is that of the causes of Becoming ann. 
Change, and the manner of conceiving the original 
substance of Being depends upon the determinations 
which appear necessary to the philosopher to explain 
Becoming :md Change. The Ionians make things arise 
(lllt of the rarefactiou and condensation of a primitive 
matter, because this best adapts itself to their notion 
-0f primitive matter ; the Pytba.goreans hold to a 
mathematical construction, because they reduce every­
thing to number; the Eleatics deny Becoming and 
:Motion, because they find the esse11ee of things in 
Being alone. On the contrary, Heracleitus makes fire 
the primitive matter, because on this theory only can 
he explain the flux. of all things; Empcdocles presup­
poses four elements and two moving forces; Leucippus 
and Democritus prcmppose the atoms and the void, 
because the multiplicity of phenomena seems to them 
to require a multiplicity of material primitive elements, 
and the change in phenomena a moving cause; .Ana:x:a­
goras was led by similar considerations to his doctrine 
of the OfLowµ,epiJ and the world-intelligence. Both 
sets of philosophers speak of Being and Becoming; but 
in the one case tbe definitions respecting Becoming

208 THE PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY. 
appear only as t1, consequence of their theory of Being; 
in the other, the definitions of Being are merely pre­
suppositions in the theory of Becoming. In assigning, 
therefore, the three most ancient schools to a first 
division of pre-Socratic Philosophy, and Hcracleitus, 
and the other physicists of the fifth century to a second, 
we follow not merely the chro1101ugical order, but the 
internal relation of tbe~e philosophers. 
The course of philosophic development in the second 
division may be more precisely described as follows ;­
First, the law of Becomiug is proclaimed by Heracleitus 
unconditionally as the universal law of the world; the 
reason of which he seeks in the original constitution of 
matter. The concept of Becoming is next enquired 
into more particularly by Empedocles and the Atomists. 
Generation is identitled with the union, and decease 
with the separation of material elements: consequently, 
a plurality of original material elements is assumed, 
the motion of which h:is to be conditioned by a second 
principle distinct from them ; but wherea~ Ernpedodes 
makes his primal eleweuts of matter qualitatively dif­
ferent one from another, and places o,er against them 
moving force in the mythical forms of friendship and 
discord, the Atomists recognise only a mathematical 
difference between the primitive bodies, and seek to 
explain their motion in a purely mechanical manner 
from the operation of weight in empty space ; space 
they consider indispensable, because without it, as they 
believe, no plurality and no change would be possible. 
This mechanical explanation of Nature Anaxagoras finds 
inadequate. He therefore sets spirit beside matter as 
8/22

THE LATER PHYSICISTS. 209 
moving cause, discriminates them one from the other as 
the compound and the simple, 11nd defines primitive 
matter as a mixture of all pa,ticuhr matters; a mix­
ture, however, in which these particuhlr matters exist 
and arc already qualitatively determined. Heraelei­
tns explains these phenomena dynamically, from the 
qualitative change of one primitive ma,tter, which is 
conceived as essentially and perpetually changing ; 
Empedoclcs and the Atomic philosophers explain them 
mechanically, from the union and separation of different 
primitive matters; Anaxagoras finally is persuaded that 
they a.re not to be explained by mere matter, but by 
the working-of the spirit upon mat,ter. At this point., 
in the nature of the case, the purely physical explana­
tiou of nature is renounced; the discrimination of spirit 
from matter, and the higher rank which it assumes in 
oppoRition to matter, demands a recasting of science 
generally on the basis of this conviction. AR, however, 
Thought is as yet incapable of such a task, the imme 
diate result is that philosophy is bewilderd in regard 
to its general vocation, despairs of ol!)edivc knowledge, 
and places ifaelf, a~ a means of fonnnl development, in 
the service of the empirical snbjeotivity which acknow­
ledges the valirlity of no universal law. This is effected 
in the third section of the pre-Socratic Philosophy by 
means of Sophistic.1

through observing that the nourishment of all animals 
is moist, and that they all originate from moist germs ; 
but this he expressly states to be merely his own conjec­
ture. It is only by later and less uccmrate authors that 
the conjecture of Aristotle is asserted as a fact, with 
the farther additions that plants draw their nourish­
ment from ,vater, and the stars themselves froip damp 
vapours; that all things in dying dry up, and that 
water is the all-organising and all-emhrncing element; 1 
that we must assume one primitive matter, because 
otherwise it would be impmsible to explain the trans­
formation of the elements one into another; and that 
that one matter mrist be water, becam:e everything is 
derived from water, by means of rarnfaction and con­
densation.2 All this makes it difficult for us to come 
to any definite conclusion on the subject. It is possible 
that the Milesian philosopher may have been influenced 
by the considerations that Arfatotle suppos:.>s ; he may 
have started from the observation tlmt everything 
living arises from a liquid, and in decaying, returns to

a liquid state; but other ob3ervations may likewise have 
conduced to this theory, such as the formation of solid 
ground from alluvion, the fertilising power of rain aud 
of streams, the numerous animrLl population of the 
waters; in conjunction with such observations, the old 
myth of Chaos aud of Oceanos, the fathAr of the gods, 
may also have had some effect oii him ; but the exact 
state of the case cannot be ascertained. Nor can we 
say whether he conceived his primitive watery matter 
as infinite; for the assertion of Simplicius 1 is mani­
festly based upon the Aristotelian passage which he is 
elucidating ;2 and this passage does not mention 
Thales. It does not even affirm that any one of the 
philosophers who held water to be the primitive matter, 
expressly attributed the quality of inti:uity to that 
element. Supposing such an assertion had been made, 
it would be more reasonable to refer it to Hippo ( v'ille 
inf1•a) than to Thales, for the infinit,y of matter is else­
where universally regarded as a conception first enter­
tained by Anaximander; Thalea: most likely never 
raised such a question at all.

primitive matter, the deity or spirit which permeates 
this matter, and from it forms the world.1 Aristotle/ 
however, ~xpressly denies that tbe ancient physiologist,,, 
among whom Thales stands first, distingufahed the 
moving cause from matter ; or that any other philo­
sopher except Anaxagoras (and, perhaps, be.fore him 
Hcrmotimus) had brought forward the doctrine of an 
intell.ig.mce organi~ing the wor1d. How couid Aristotle 
have used such language if he had known that Thales 
named God the reason of the world ? But if he dill not 
know H, we may be sure that the assertions of later

who succeeded him regarded God or the Divine Spirit 
as the framer of the universe, but that Anaxagoras was 
the first to hold this doctrine. We ma.y, the1·efore, 
certainly conclude that the opposite theory is an error 
of the post-Aristotelian period, the source of which we 
shall present1y find in some passages of Aristotle. It 
by no means follows from this that Thale8 personally be­
lieved in no god or gods ; 1 but the tradition that credits 
him with the thesis that God is the oldest of all things, 
bccau8e He has had no beginning, is not very trustworthy. 
For this assertion is no better attested than the innu­
merable other apophthegms ascribed to the seven sages, 
and was probably athibu.ted to Thales originally in 
some collection of their sayings in the same arbitrary 
manner that other sayings were attributed to the. rest. 
Moreover, Xenophaues is ehew here in variably couside.rcd 
as the first who, in opposition to the Hellenic religion, 
declared t11e Deity to uavc had no beginning. Accord­
ing to certain authors, Thales taught that the world is 
full of gods. This statement is mnch more probable 
than the preceding.2 But what arc we to understand by

the expression, the diffusion of the sou] throughout the 
universe 7 Aristotle's cautious 'perhaps' shows us how 
little such au interpretation is supported by tradition. 
Indeed, it may safely be asserted that not only later 
writers, but Aristotle hiwself, in his own way, ascribed 
notiom to 'l'halcs which we have no right to expect 
from him. That he conceived all things as living, and 
personified all active forr.es after the analogy of the 
human soul, is certainly probable, because tl1is is ii:t 
harmony with the imaginative view of nature which 
everywhere, and especially among the Greeks, precedes 
scientific enquiry: it is, therefore, quite credible that 
he may (as Aristotle affin:us) haYe attributed a soul to 
the magnet/ on account of its power of attraction-that 
i~ to say, regarded it as a living being·. In the same 
manner, doubtless, he conceived his primitive matter as 
/ living, so that, like the ancient Chaos, it could beget 
all things by itself, without the intervention of an or­
ganising ~pirit. It fa also entirely consonant with 
ancient, Greek thought that he shonld see present 
deities in the forces of nature, and a proof in the life 
of nature, that nature is full of gods. 'But we cannot 
befo,ve that he combined the several powers of nature; 
and the souls of· sepa1·ate beingsi in the notion of a 
worid-soul; for that notion presnpposc-s that the infi­
nite multiplicity of phenomena has become a unity in 
tbc conception of the world; and that effieient power

viduals1 where this is natma1 in the simpler stages of 
opinion, hut in the universe generally./ Both ideas 
seem t.o lie beyond the fir8t narrow limits of early 
philosophy, and the historical evidence does not justify 
us in attributing them to Thales.1 \Ve may con­
cludf:, therefore, tlrnt while he conceived his primitive 
matter as living and generativei while be shared the

cousjderation of nature, he knew nothing of a world­
soul or c::•f a spirit permeating matter and forming the 
uni verse, 2 
As to the manner in which things originated from 
water, Thales seems to be silent. Aristotle certainly 
says that the physicists, who hold one qualitr1.ti vely rfo­
termined primitive matt.er, make things arise out of it 
by rarefaction and eondensation,3 but it does not follow 
that all these philosophers without exception were of 
that opinion. 4 Aristotle might have used the ~amc

and if it appeared to hir!t the most logical theory of 
derivation. Simplicius l is the fint who expressly con­
nects Thales with Ana:x:.imenes as having adopted this 
theor_y ; not only, ho\vever, does Theophrastus disagree 
with him, but Simplicius tells us himself that his state­
ment is only based upon the general bct"lring of Aristotle's 
words.~ What is said by Galen 3 in a passage of doubt­
ful connection, and also by other writers,4 in a similar 
strain, is most likely taken from the same source. It 
is most probable, on the whole, therefore, that Thales 
never eritertained the queRtion, but contented himself 
with the in_clf;lp.nite notion that things arose or were 
produced out of watei-, 
"\\'hat we hear from other sources about the doctrine 
of Thales consists merely of isolated empirical obser­
vations 01· conjectures, or e]Pe of statements so imper­

to flmt on the water ; for this would harmonise per­
fectly with the the0ry of the earth's origin from 
water, and easily adapt itself to the old cosmological 
notions: we mn.y also connect with it the fnrther state­
ment I that he explained earthquakes hy the movement 
of the wat.er. This la;;t, assertion, however, seems to 
rest fmt.irely on one of the writings falsely ascribed to 
'l'hale~, and doubtles~ the ultimate source of other 
doctrines t,hat h,1ve been aUribnted to him. The 
statement of Aristotle is better attellted, but we gain 
little information, e,•en from him, as to the doctrine of 
Thales as a wb.ole.2 All that we know of it may, in 
fact, be reduced to the proposition that water is the 
matter out of which everything arises and consists. 
The reasons that determined liim to this theory can 
only now· he c011jectnred; how be more closely defined 
the process of the origimti.m of things from water is 
also very 1.rnccrtain; but it is most probable that he 
comidered primitive matter, like nature in general, tc 
be animate, and that he he1d to the indeterrninak con­
ception of beginning-or generation, without defining 
H1is as brought abont by the rarefaction or condensa­
tion of the primitive matter. 
However meagre and insignifieant this theory may 
seem, it wns, at lrust, an attempt to explain phenomena 
by one general natnral principle, and in this light it 
was of tLe highest importance; we find that a series of

• On the other band, this theory 
militates again,t the supposition 
(Plut. Plae. iiL 10) that he held the

TIIE INFINITE. 229 
speak of the infinite; and among the physicists he 
unquestionably reckons Anaximandcr. 1 According to 
the unanimous testimony of later authors,2 Anaximan­
der\; main argument for his theory was that the infinite, 
and the infinite alone, does not exhaust itself in con~ 
stantly producing. This is the very argument that 
Aristotle quotes 3 as tbf chief ground for maintaining 
an infinite corporeal matter; and he does so in speaking 
of the theory which we 1·ccognise as Anaximander's, 
viz. that the infinite is a body distiuct from the de­
terminate clemfonts. From the infinite, Anaximander 
(whom Aristotle for thU,t. 1·eason places beside Empe­
docles and Aua::rngoras) derived particular kinds of 
maUer, and the world which is compounded of them, 
by means of separation 4 ( A U8scheidmig ), a doctrine 
which would be impos~ible uuless the infinite were 
it.self something material. Lastly, tbough it is difficult 
to disco,•e1· how this philosopher precisely ,defined hi,; 
infinile, all testimony is agreed as te its corporeal 
nature ; and among the pas3agcs of Aristotle which 
possibly may refer to Anaximander, and of which some 
m1rnt of necessity refer to him, there is none which 
does not imply this corporeal nature.• That he in-

that this proof is not conclusive ; but it might never­
theless have appeared sufficient to the unpractised 
thought of the earliest philosophers,1 and we must at 
any rate allow that Anaximander, by maintaining the 
theory, first raised an important question in philo­
sophy. 
So far there is little room for disagreement; but 
opinions are greatly divided as to the more precise 
meaning of Anaximander's primitive matter. The 
ancients are pretty nearly unanimous in a~serting that 
it did not coincide with either of the four elements ; i 
according to some it was not a determinate body at all, 
others describe it as intermediate 'between water and 
air, or again between air and fire; while a third aecount 
represents it as a mixture of all partiwlar kinds of 
matter; a mixture in which these have been always 
contained, as distinct and determinate, so th&t they 
can be evolved from it by mere separation, without any 
change in their constitution. This last theory has 
formed the basis in modern times 3 of the assertion 
I The same mistake, howe,cr,

THE IN.Pl.NlTE. 
that among the earlier, no less than among the later 
Ionic philosophers, there were two classes-the Dy­
namists. and the J\fochanists-Le. those who derived all 
things from one primitive matter by means of a vital 
traosformation, and those who derived them from a 
multiplicity of unchanging primitive matters by means 
of separation and combination in space. To the first 
belong Thales and Anaximenes, Heracleitus and Dio~ 
genes; to the second, Anaximander, with Anaxagora1 
and Archclaus. We will now examine tbis theory; 
since it has an important. bearing not only on the 
doctrine before us, but also on the whole history of 
ancient Philosophy. 
Much may be said in its beh21f. Simplicius ! ap­
pears to ascribe the same view to Anaximander which 
we find in Anaxagoras, viz. that in the sepamtion of 
matters frow the infinite, kindred elements become

earth, and so on, these different and distinct kinds of

matter having been already contained in the original 
mass. His authority for this statement is supposed to 
be Theophrastns. "\Ve meet with the same view, how­
ever, elsewhere, 1 and Aristotle seems to justify it when 
he describes Anaximander's primitive matter as a mix­
ture.2 He aho expressly mentions him as one of the 
philosophers who thought particular kinds of matter 
were developed from the one primitive matter, not by 
rarefaction and condensatjon, but by separation.3 This 
proves, apparently beyond question, that Aristotle 
himself conceived this primitive matter of Anaximan­
der as analogous to that of Anaxagoras; for that which 
has to be separated from matter must previously have 
been contained in it. But these reasons, on closer in­
spection, are very insufficient.4 In regard to the Aris­
totelia.n passages, Aristotle himself tells us r, that he 
uses the expressions 'separated ' and 'contained,' not 
only where one kind of matter fa contained in another

Anaximander represents the particular substances as 
separating themselves from the primitive matter, it does 
not at all follow that they were, all the~e definite snb­

be equally con9eived as the indeterminate essence out 
of which the determinate is ultimately dcvclopedhy a 
qualitative change. As to the comparison of Ana:id­

goras can only he held to agree with Anaximander on 
the subject of primitivemattcr if we attribute to him as 
his ol'iginal principle a matter without definite qualities 
(µ,{a cpv,n5' J,/,purros ), instead of a mixture of deter­
minate and g_ua1itatively distinct substances.1 That 
the doctrine of Anaxagoras might ultimately be reduced 
to this theory, whi~h is certainly divergent from its 
primary sense, had already heen remarked by Aristotle.2 
'I'beophrastus 3 drew the same inference, and makes his 
comparison of Anaxa.goras with Anaximander c·ontingent 
on its admfosion. Thi$ shows that he ascribed t-0 
Anaximan<lcr a primitive matter in which no particular 
qualities of bodies were as yet present, not a matter 
that comprehended all particnhr substances as such 
within itself. Besides, the text in question does not 
attribute this latter doctrine to Ana.-:imander ; for the

Anaxagoras.5 }1oreover these words are not given by

tained so long as it opposes nothing that demonstrably . . 
comes from Theophrastus. Schleiermaclier I and Brandis2 
have conclusively shown that Simplicius had no accurate 
and independent knowledge o_f Anaximander's doctrine, 
and that his utterances .-,n the subject are involved in 
glaring contra.dictions. His evidence, therefore, should 
not induce us, auy more than that of Augustine and 
Sidonius or Philoponus, to attribute to Anaxirnander a 
doctrine explicitly denied to him by Tbeophrastns. On 
the other hand, the testimony of so trustworthy a 
witness as Tbeophrastus, together with the further 
evidence hereafter to be cited, justifies us in main­
taining that this philosopher dill not regard. his primitive 
matter, as a mixture of particular matters, and that 
conseq11enlly it is improper to separate him, as an 
adherent of a mechanical system of physics, from the 
dynamists Thales and Anaximcncs. And this so much 
the more, as it is improbable, on general grounds, that 
the view which Ritter attributes to him should belong 
to so ancient a period. The tbeol'y of unchanging 
primitive substances presupposes, on the one side, the 
reflection that the properties of the several kindfl of 
matter could have bad no beginning, any more th<tn 
matter as u whole; but am.-,ng the Greeks we do not 
meet with this thought until after the period when the 
possibility of Becoming was der1ied by Parmenides, to 
whose propositious on this subject Empedocles, Anaxa­
goras, and Democritus expressly go back, On the other 
side, this theory ( of unc1mnging primitive matter) is 
united in Anaxagoras with t~e idea of an intelligence

that orders the world; and even the analogous notions 
of Empedocles and the atomists were conditioned by 
their conception of efficient causes. None of these 
philosophers could have conceived a primitive matter 
as qualitatively unchangeable, if each-Anaxagoras in 
vovs, Empedocles in Hate and Love, the Alomists in 
the Void-had not also admitted a special principle of 
movement. No one bas diwovered any snch doctrine 
in Ana:s:im:mder; 1 nor can we conclude, from the small 
fragment known to us of his work,2 that lie placed 
motive force in individual things, and supposed them 
to come forth by their own impulse from the original 
mixture; it is the infinite itself 3 that moves all things.

~eeking such a theory in Auaximander in opposition to 
the most trustworthy evidence. 
If Anaximandcr did not conceive his primitive 
matter as a mixture of pitrticular substances, but as a 
homogeneous mass, we must next enquire what was 
the nature of this mass. The ancients, beginning 
with Aristotle, unanimously assert that it consfotcd of 
none of the. four elements. Aristotle several times 
mentions the view that the primitive matter in re­
gard to its density is intermediate between water and 
air,1 or bebveen air and fire/ and not a. few ancient 
writers 3 have referrecl these ~ssertions to Anaximan­
der; for example, Alexander,4 'l'hemi.stius," Simplicius,6 
l'hiloponus,7 and A~clepins.8 But. although this theory 
has been recently defended~ against Schleiermacher's 
objections,10 I cannot convince mpelf that it is well 
t!w primitii,e matter, the 1,,wpw; 
and I mri.intai11, pl'cciscly for that 
reason, that he µlaced th~ motive 
power in t.his primitivB rnatter it­
self, and derived the motion of the 
heavens from that of thB /l.,,-s,po~. 
it'here is the contradiction?

on the other hand, the very next words clearly imply 
the contrary. For Aristotle here ascribes to the philo­
sophers, who lwlieved tbo primitive matter to bo some­
thing intermediate between air and water, the theory 
th11,,t, things originated from primitive matter by means 
of rarefaction and condensation; and this he distinctly 
denies of Anaximander. 1 No other passage can be

appear to be entirely based on the passages in Arfatotle. 
Simpliciu~, at any rate, cannot be quoting directly from 
Anaximander, otherwise be could not 8peak so unde­
cided1y as he does,1 and he could not ascribe to this phi­
losopher, as jf it were a subject of indifference, the double 
theory of matter us intermediate between air and fire, 
and again as intermediate between air and water ;2 for 
these two-tbeo-ries obviously exclude one anot.hcr, and 
cannot both liave been fonnd in Anaximander's work. 
Nor can Simplicius have found among his predecessors 
allusions to that work, otherwise a different tum would at 
once have been given to the discussion. The same may 
be said of Porpbyry,3 who in that case would not have 
grounded his opinion ( whic11 differ~ from thA opinion of 
Alexander) solely upon the Aristotelian passage. This 
also holds good of Alexander4 and Philoponus/ Tbese 
later statements, therefore, one and all, depend entirely 
upon conjecture, and the words of Aristotle were only 
referred to Anaximander because they seemed to apply 
to no other philosopher. Now.it is clear from the un­
d011bted testimony of the wost trustworthy authorities,

as intermediate between two definite kinds .,.f matter ; 
but that he either was silent as to its natnre, or ex-· 
'pressly described it as that to which none of the pro­
perties of part,icular substan~es belongs. For when 
Ari~h,tle, in the ahu v,c:-mentioueu pas,u.ge, speaks 
generally of those who posited as primitive matter a 
definite element, or something intermediate between 
two elements, and derived all other things from it by 
the processes of rarefadion and condensation, it is 
ohvious that his design is not to dni.w a distinction 
between the8e philosophers and others who equally as­
sumed a primitive nmtter of the ~arne kind, but made 
things to arise out of i.t in a different manuer. On the 
c011trary, in refuting the theory ot' a derivati<:m of tbiugs 
by meall.S of rarefaction and conden8ation, he believes 
that he has refuted the geueral theory of a primitive 
matter of definite quality. This is still clearer frorn the 
passage in the Phy/jics, i. 4.1 ' Some of them/ he hero 
says, 'starting from the pre-supposition of a determi­
nate primitive matter, make thing8 to originate from it 
by means of rarefaction a11d condensation; others, like 
Ana.x.imander, Anaxagoras, and Empedocles, maintain 
that opposites aro a1reaclJ contained in the One primi­
tive rn,,tter, and arn produced from it by means of 
separation.' Here it is perfectly evident that he con­
cei,,es rarefaction and condeiwation to he as essentially 
connected with the theory of a qualitatively deterrnim:d 
mattflr, as separation with that of au original mixtune 
of all things, or of a matter without qualitative deter­
minateness. . Nor can it be otherwise; for in order to

arise by separation out of the primitive matter, parti­
cular matters must either potentially or actually have 
bf\en contained in it; but this would only be possible if 
the primiti~·e matter were itself not a particular matter, 
n.ot merely intennediate between two other particular 
matterH: but including them all equally in itself, If 
we further consider that this chapter of the Physics 
is occupied, not with the manner in which things 
originate from. elements, but ,,ith the number and 
nature of pi,imitive substances them~elves_,' it seems 
beyond question that Amtximander was opposed to the 
rest of the Ionia.ns, not only from the first point of 
view, but from the second, and that consequently his 
infinite can have been neither one of the four elements, 
which were afterwards admitted, nor an intermediary 
between two of these elements. This probably explains 
why Anaximander is passed over in }lfetciph. i. 3, and 
also a remark,2 which otherwise would have no histori­
cal point, and which the Greek commentators 3 them­
selves apply to him. 'Some,' says Aristotle, 'SE'ek the 
Infinite, not in any particular element, but in that out 
of wbieh all particular elements arose; because each 
particular sub$tance, c<mceived as infinite, must exclude 
those SU bstances that are opposed to it.' This reason,

THE INFINITE. 2J7 
indeed, which points to the later theory of the elements, 
can hardly have been so stated by Anaxirnander. But 
whether ATiBtotlo inferrecl it, after his manner, from 
some ambiguous utterance, or arrived at it by his own 
conjecture, or whether later authors may, perhaps, have 
interpolated it, the doctrine in support of which it is 
adduced no doubt belongs originally to Anaximander. 
1'heophrastns expressly says so 1 in describing Anaxi­
mander's Infinite as One matter without qualitati\'e 
determinateness; and with this Diogenes2 and the 
Pseudo-Plutarch,3 and among the c·ommentators of 
Aristotle, l'orphyry, and pmbably also Nicolaus of 
Damascus,~ agree ; of these the two first, at any rate, 
appeared to have used a speci,i1 source. Simplicius 
himself says elsewhere t.he same thiDg.~ That Anaxi­
mandcr's primitive matter was not a qualitatively 
dot.ermined matter is, tbtlrefore, certain ; the only 
doubt that remains is whether he expressly denied to it 
all determination, or merely ab~tained from qualifying 
it at all. The latter hypothesis is the more probable of 
the two; it is actually maintained by some of our 
authorities, and appears simpler and, therefore, more in 
accordance with so ancient a system, than the other 
theory, which constantly presupposes considerations like 
those above cited from Aristotle; it also furnishes the

248 AN AXDJ,fANDER. 
most reasonable explanation of the fact that Aristotle 
only mentions Anaxinumder when he is discussing the 
question of the finiteness or infinity of matter, and of 
the production of things from it, and not when he is 
dealing with its elementary composition; for in tl1e 
case we arc assuming, no distinct utterance of Anaxi­
mander would have been known to him on tbis point, 
as· on the two former (not even the negative state­
ment that the Infinite is not a particular substance), 
and so he prefers to be wholly silent on the subject. I 
therefore believe that Anaxirnander held simply to this 
proposition: that the Infinite or infinite matter existed 
before parti::mlar things. As to the material constitu­
tion of this primitive substance, lie has given us no 
precise information. 
Anaxiwander further taught that the Infinite is 
eternal and imperishable.1 In this seme he is said 
to have designated the first principle of all things 
by the eKpression apxf 9 He conceived motive power

Aristotle says (loo. &it.), he taught that, the Iufinitc not 
merely contained, but directed all things.2 Re thus 
regarded matter, after tbe manmir of the early Hylo­

this motion he supposed it to prorluce all things from 
itself. ·when Aristotle (loo. cit.), therefore, de;;ig·nates

We are farther told that he represented particular 
substances as developing themselves from the primitive 
matter by means of separation ( iK1'p{v:ea8ai, a7roKp{~ 
vw-Oai),1 and Anaximander himself seems to have used 
this word ;2 but what he precisely understood by sepa­
ration does nut appear. He apparently left this con­
ception in the same uncertainty as that of the primitive 
m11tter, and that which floated before his mind was 
merely the general notion of an emergence of the 
several matters distinct from one another, out of the 
original homogeneons mass. We hear, on the other 
hand, that he made the division of heat .and cold the 
first result of this separation.3 From the mixture of

that we find upon U1e rnbject.1 The heavenly hodies 
were formed of fire and air; when the fiery circle of 
the universe burst asunder, and the fire was pent up in 
wheel-shaped husks of compressed air, from the apertures 
of which it streams forth ; the stoppage of these aper­
tures occasions eclipses of the snn and moon, and the 
waxing and waning of the moon are produced in tlie

of the earth; and, again, the heat of the sun assists the 
drying up of the globe and the formation of the 
sky,1 That the moon and planets shine by their owa 
light 2 follows necessarily from Anaximander's theories 
reHpeding them. The movement of the heavenly 
bodies he derived from the currents of air caused 
.plpiu~c.,, which is confirmed by tho 
,rpo:imt Tnv uvp~Po~, attributed to 
him by Ari~totle (Metoor. ii. 2, :lJfi,

f p!ieres; these sphe.res, in thefr 
mtalion, pour forth fhe thmug;h an 
aperture, ,ind prorlue~ the pheno­
menon of a fiery Lody circling mund 
the eanh. As, however, these rings 
only ron,ist of air, Toichmiiller is 
not wrong- (p. 32 sq.) in rfopiiting 
the thP.nr_y of solirl sphern, and a 
solid firmament (Rulli, lac. oit. : 
Grnppe, Co,m. Sy.It. d. G1·. p. 37

Jn agTeement witl1 tltis view, thBre 
is the ~trLtement (Slob. ,548; Plm:. 
ii. 25, 1; G<1len, c. la) tli:.t, ac­
cording to Anaximander, tJw moon 
is a circle nineteen tim~s a~ lMge

sible that this philosopher, for

When, however, wo learn from the

ascribed to him. In accordance with the notious of 
antiquity, Anaximrwdcr, we arc told, regarded the stars 
as gods, and spoke of an innumerable or infinite 
multitude of heavenly gods.1 
The Eartl1 he supposes to have existed at first in a 
liquid state, and to have been gradually formed by the 
drying np of the moisture by means of the ,mrrounding 
fire; the rest, having become s,1lt and biUer, running 
off into the se:l.2 Its ;;hape he conceives as a cylinder, 
tbo hBight of which is a third part of its bre,1Clth ; we 
inhabit its upper surface.3 At rest in the c_entre of all 
things, its equilibrium is maintained because it is 
eqnally distant from the extreme limits of tht1 universe.' 
The animals aho, he thougbt, originated from primi­
tive slime, under the influence of the sun's heat, and as 
the idea of a. gradual succes8ion of animal species cor­
responding with the periods of geologica.1 formation was

naturally beyond his reach, he assumed that the laud 
animals, including man, had at first been fishes, and 
afterwards, when they were able to devefope themselves 
under their new shape, had come on shore and thrown 
off their scales.1 He is said to have regarded the soul 
as of the nature of a.ir, ~ and we have no reason to think 
this improbable; what, however, is more certain, is 
that in his theories of the origin of rain, of the winds, 
of thunder and lightning,3 almost everything is re­
ferred to the influence of air. But these theories have 
little connection with his philosophic doctrine. 
As all things were produced from one primitive 
matter, so must all return to it; for all things, says our 
pliilo~opher,4 must undergo, according to the order of 
time, penance and punishment for their injustice. The 
separate existence of individual things is, so t,o speak, a 
wrong, a transgression which they must ex:piate by their 
destruction. Anaxagoras is said to haye applied the 
same principle to the world as a whole, and to bave 
admitted, in consequence, that the world would be 
destroyed, but that on account of the perpetual motion 
of the infinite suhstance, a new world would be

dispute.' \Ve are repeatedly a~mrcd that Anaximarnler 
spoke of innumerable wo.rlds, but whethe1· he meant by 
this, wor1ds in juxtaposition, or worlds in succession,-~ 
and whether, upm1 the former theory, he thought of ;1 
number of complet.e systems, separate from eaeh other, 
or only different parb of one and the same system, arc 
questions that are not easily answered.2 Cicero ic,ays that 
Anaximander regarded the countless worlds as gods, 
This would incline u~ to the idea of whole systems, like 
tlw worlus of Dcmocdtus. The eountle~~ 'heavens' of 
which Stobreus speak,; ( as alw the PGeudo-Galen) seem 
to necessitate the same interpretati.011, since Cyrillus, 
substitutes 'worl<ls' for 'be,wen~.' The Pla0ita, how­
ever, }iavc the word • stars,' and this we mu,t take to 
have been Anaximander's real meaning. For if he ha<l 
said the innumerable world~ that are wppo;;ed fo exist 
outside our system are gDds, he would not merely have 
~tood alone among all the ancient philosophers, but it 
would bediAfoult to say how he could ha;vH anived at such 
a theorem. 1<'01' in all perimls, and without exception, 
gods huve been undcr.,tood to mes1,n king,; that are the 
objects of humaIL adoration : even tli0 gods of Epicurus 
are so, though, on their side, they trouble themselve;:; 
little about men. 3 But these worlrfa, entirely with­
drawn from oul' pe1w:ption 5 and sight, and adII1i Ued

capable of impiring our adoration, and have nothing in 
themselves that could appeal to the feeling of piety ; 
whereas the aneient worship of the stars, deeply rooted 
as it was in the Hellenic modes of thought, is to be 
met with perpetually, as we know, among the philoso­
phers. Anaximauder's count.less gods must, therefore, 
be the stars. The _explanation of hi.s likewise calling 
these gods 'heavens' may be found in what we have 
gathered about his conception of the stars. That which 
we behold under the form of sun, moon, or stars, is to 
Anaxi.mander only a lmninous aperture in a ring which 
is formed of air aml filled with fire, and rotates at a 
greater or 1ess clfatance around the earth. The cor1-
cent-ric light-emitting rings which thus surround us, 
and together with the earth form the universe, might 
therefore be properly called heavens, and perhaps they 
might be ca1led worlds ; 1 but it is likewise pos~ible that 
later writer~, adopting the language of their own times, 
may have substit1ited 'worlds' for ' heavens' by way 
of explanation or emendation. Beddes, Anaximander 
might well 8peak in this sense of an infinite number 
of heavens; ~inc8 (in accordance with this theory) lie 
must have regarded the £xed stars, not as placed in a 
single sphcrc,2 but each one as the apertnre of its own 
ring. For at so early a period as Anaximander's, it 
ought not to surprise us if that which no man conld 
reckon were called infinite in number. 
1 Simplicius, for exri.mple, says 
(in tJrn p,1~s,1.ge quoted S!lpra, p, 233, 
l) of Ana.:rngoms, to whom nobody

INJ<'INITB SERIES OF WORLDS. 259 
On the other hand, the as:;ertion which ascribes to 
Anaximander an infinity of successive worlds seems to 
be borne out by his system. The correlative of the 
world's formation is the world's de8truction; if U1e 
world, as a living-beingi dcvcJoped itself at a definite 
epoch out of it given matter, it may cnsily be supposed 
that it will also be dis~o1ved, like a living being, into 
its constituent clemenfa again. If creative force and 
movement, as essential anrl original qualities, be_ 
ascribed to this p1·imitive matter, it is only logical to 
conclude that hy virtue of its vitality it will produce 
another world after the destruction of our own; and for 
the same reason it must have prod11ced other worlds 
prior to the earth. Thus we assume an infinite series 
of successive worlds in the past and in the future. 
Plutarch, indeed, expressly says of Anaximander, th~t 
from the Infinite, as t.he sole cause of the birth ri,nd 
destruction of all things, he conside.red that the heavens 
and the innnmera1Jle worlds arise in endles~ circulation, 1 
and Hippolytus speaks to the same cffect.2 • The Infi­
nite of Anaximander,' he says, 'etnnal >tnd n.;ver 
growing oltl, embraces all the worlds; but these have 
each of them a set titne for their ari~ing, their exfrt-

mention of innumerable worlds, wLich in long periods 
of time ari~c and perish; awl Sbb.:cus attributes to 
Anaxirrmnder the theory of the future destruction of 
the world.3 This is also countenanced by the state­

for in that case there would be an inereasing prepon­

closely to Anaximander than to any of the ancient 
Ionian physicists, and also most probably by Anaxiw

does not require, but oft.en actually contradicts. We 
might imagine that it neces8arily resulted from the 
uu!irnitedness of matter ; but the successors of Auaxi­
mander, Anaximenes, Anaxagorns, and Diogenes, prom 
how little such necessity existed at· that early stage of 
thougbt. Kone of tbew find any difficulty in supposing 
our world tu be limited, white the matter surround­
ing it, and not formed into any other worlds, extemls 
itself to infinity. The reflection which Schleiennacher 
attrilmtcs to our philosophcr,1 that there must be many 
worlds, in ordel' that death and destruction may mle in 
one, while life and .-itality prevail in another, appears 
much too artifical for the time. It is, therefore, 
difficult to see bow Ana:x:imauder could have been led 
to a theory which is so entirely independent of the 
;;ensible intuition, the immediate origin of all ancient 
cosmology. Such a theory must, indeed, have been 
peculiarly remote from a philosopher holding so de­
cidedly, as Anaximander did, t.hat every particular was 
derived from one first principle, and ret1Hned to it. 
again.2 Dernot:ritu$ was quite logieal when he made his 
innumerable atoms, which were guided hy no uniform 
principle, eom1)ine with one another in the most diverse 
parts of infinit!c! space, and so form iud!c!peudeut world­
systems. Ana:x:imauder,on the contrary,starting from his 
conception of the One Unlimited which rules all thing;,, 
collld only arrive at the theory of a single m1iYerse, 
combined by the unity of the force that forms the world.

If .we now rc11npare Anaximamler's doctrin(', as re­
prescnte<l in our presGnt enquiry, with what we know of 
the uw.t_:rine of Thalcet, WP. ohall find that it is far richer 
in content, and 'betokens a higher development of philo­
sophic thought. I -am not indeed inclined to ascribe 
:my great significance to the corn:.eption which is prin­
cipally dwelt on by historians as constit.11t.i11g the most 
convenient de!<igiiat.ion for Anaxirna.ndcr's princi pie, 
viz., ihe infinity of primiti.ce matter~ for the endless 
snccession of natnml creatfons, which chiefly determined 
Anaximii.nder in adopting-it~ might hai'e been attained 
independently of this principle; 1 and the unlimited 
extension of the wmld in space, which would have ne­
ccBSitated it, was not tornght, as we have seen, by t.hi,i 
philosopher. On the other h,wd, it is an important faet. 
that Anaxim11.0der should have taken for his point of 
departure, not a determinate sub5tance Jike Th:.le,:;, but 
indeterminate and infinite matt.er; anil whatever may 
have led him to sueh a. doctrine, it implies an advance 
on hi,:; pa.rt be,yonrl merely sensuous observiitiou. Thales 
said nothing about the manner in ,,;:-hich things arise 
-0ut of tLc primitive matter. The 'separation' of Auaxi­
manfler is st.ill sufficiently vague, hut, it-is at any rate 
an attempt to foi-m some notion of the process, to reduee 
the multip1icity of phenomena t.o the most general oppo­
sitions, and to attain a physical theory of the gcneHis of 
the world, free from the mythical clem~nts of the an­
cient theogooic cosmology. The ideas of Anaximander 
on the system of the world, and the origin of living 
being~, not only sbow reflection, but have exercised

imporhint influence on ,mh,wqucnt philosophy. Finally, 
he admitted a beginning as well as an encl of onr world, 
anrl an infinite series of succes~ivc worlds. This doc­
trine evince;; remarkable consistency of thought. It is 
besides the fir~t. st.ep towri.rds the abandonment of the 
mythicrtl notion of the origin of t11e world in time, and 
through the idea that creative force cau never lrnvc

I cannot, however) flg"ret' in t11e opinion that Amixi­

rnc-cessors, and assigned to a special order of develop­
ment. Thi~ opinion has been maintained in modem 
times and on opposite grounds by Schleiermacher 1 and 
Ritter: 2 by Schleierma{:her, becau~e Le sccs in Anaxi­
mauder the commeneernent of ~pcculative natural 
science; by Rittr,r, because he regards him as the 
founder of the mechanical and more experimental 
phyc,ks. ·with reference to the latter, it has a1ready 
been shown that Anaxirnandcr's theory of natnre ha~ as 
little a mechanical character a~ i"hat of bis pre<lecesrnr 
or immediate succes~ors, and that he <'~pecially approxi­
mates to Hcradeitus, the typical dynamist. For the 
Rame reasom, Sd1leiermacher is incorrect in a,serting 
that, in contra~l with Thales and Anaxirnenm,, bid ten­
dency is more towards the particular than the universal;

contl'aries emanate from the primitivf; substance; but 
this proves nothing, since Anaximenes and Diogenes hold 
the same opinion. Lastly, I mmt dispute the assertion 
of Ritter I that Anaximauder owed nothing to Thales. 
Even supposing that from a material point of view 
lie appropriated none of Thales' ideas, it was formally 
of the highest importance that Thctles should first have 
instituted the enquiry concerning the uniYersal principle 
of all things. \Ve have, however, already seen that Anaxi­
mauder was probably connected wit.h Thales, not only by 
his hylozoism, but by the particular theory of the liquid 
state of the earth in its commencement. If we farther 
consider that he was a follow citizen and youuger con­
temporary of Thales, and that both philosophers were 
well known and highly esteemed in their native city, it 
seems unlikely that llO iwpube ~Louk] }mvc been received 
by the younger from the elder; and that Anaxirnander, 
standing midway chronologically between his two com­
patriots, Thales and Auaximenes, should be isolated 
from them scientifically. The contrary ,vill become 
still more appitrent when we see the influence exercised 
by Anaximandcr o.-er his own immediate :mcce,;sor.

THE prilosophic theory Df Anaximenes is generally de­

it is true, may also apply to Diogenes or Arehelaus,

Simplieius saysJ that Anaximenf's made air his firl't 
principle because of its variable nature, which especially 
fits it to be the substratum of changing phenomena. 
According to the utterances of Anaximenes himself,4 he 
seems t.n have been led to thfa theory chiefly by the 
analogy of the world with a living being. It appeared 
to him (in agreement with the ancient opinion, founded 
on Uie evidence of the senses) that in men and animals 
the expiration and inspiration of the air is the eanse of 
life, and of the cohesion of the body; for when the 
breathing cea.s.es or is hindered, life becomes extinct, 
ried the terre~trir,J suhstunces int.o 
the cenue, existed before these 
subst;inces; r,nd this by no means 
necessarily follows. Democritus, 
for instance, does not conceive the 
atom~ as. originally whir1int; thM 
movement arises only at certain 
points from the percu~sicrn of the 
atom~.

RAREFACTIOl\7 AND CONDE:SSATIO~Y. 271 
the body decomposes and perishes. It was nn,tural for 
Anaximencs to suppose that such might also be the 
case with the world. For the belief that the world was 
nnimate was very ancient, and had ahead y been intro­
duced into physics by his predccesson. So in the 
manifold and important effects of the air, which are 
patent to ohscrvaLion, he readily found proof that it. is 
the air which moves and pro<lucc;; all things. Ent 
pl1ilosophy had not yet attained to the discrimination 
of motive cau~e from matter. The above announcement., 
therefore, was equivalent to saying that the air i~ the 
primitive matter; and this theory was likewise sup­
ported ly common ohKervation, and Ly a coujecturn 
which might eu.~ily occur t.o thf< mind. Rain, hai.l, and 
snow, on the one hand, and fiery plmnomena on the 
other, may equally be regarded as products of the a.ir. 
Thus the idea might easily arise that the air :mnst be 
the matter out of which all the other bodies are formed, 
some of them tending upwards, and others downwards ; 
and this opinion might likewise be baRed on the appa- , 
rently unlimited diffusion of the air in space, espeeially 
as Anaximander had declared the infinite to be thP 
primitive sub~tance. 
All things then, says Anaximenes, spring from the 
air by rarefaction or by condensation.1 TheHe processes

with heating, and condemat.ion with cooling.2 The 
~tages througli which matte.r: has to pass in the co1ir8e

Sirnplicius, 1 which mutually support and complete one 
another, in attribut.ing to him the doctrine of an alter­
nate construction and de~truction of the world. 
The hypotheses concerning the origin of rain, snow, 
hail, lightning, the rninbow,2 and earthquakes,3 ,vbich 
are ascribed to Ana:dmenes, :-:orndimcs on good au­
thority, are for us of secondary importance; and his 
theory of the Tiature of the son],• based chiefly upon 
the ordinary popular opinion, he himself does not seem 
to have further developed. 
This survey of the doctrines attributed to Anaxi­
menes may now enable us to determine the que~­
tiou already raised : did Anaximenea owe uothing to 
Anaximander except in some minor points of his en­
quiry?" It ~eems to me that his philosophy taken a~ 
a whole dearly betrays the influence of his prcdcccc­
tmr. For Anaximandcr had in all probability already 
cxpres$ly a~~ert.ed not only the infinitj\ bnt the ani­
mate nature and perpetual motion of primitive matter. 
Anaximcncs reiterates these theories, and, hy virtue 
of them, seems to reach his conclusion that air is the 
primitive matter. It is true that be returns from the 
he,re !tHcril,~d, not to A naxhmrndsr, 
&e., hut only to t.ho Stoics; !.hough 
it is not improbabl~ that Anaxi·

indeterminate conception of infinite substance to a 
determinate substance, and that he reprc,;ents things as 
ari~ing· out of this not by ,;qmration, but by rarefaction 
and conden~at.ion. Rut at the same time he is evidently 
concerned to maintain what Anaxag-oras had held about 
the primitive snbstauce ; and thu8 hi,; principle may 
be described <18 the combination of the two previous 
principles. With 'Jha1es, he accept~ the qualitative 
determinateness of primitive mutter; with Anaximander 
he expressly asserts its infinity and animation. For 
the rest he inclines diiefly to Anaximander. Even if 
we cannot with justice ascribe to him the doctrine of 
the destruction of the world, and of innumerable worlds 
iu succession, we ctLU still see his <lependenc.; on his 
prericee~sor I in his ideas concerning tbe primitive 
opposition of heat and cold; the form uf the earth and 
stars, on atmospheric phenomena, in what he says of the 
stars as the created gods, perhaps also in the opinion 
that the soul is like air in its nature. Yet this depen­
dence is not so great., nor his own original achievement 
so insignificant that we should be _justified in refusing 
to recognise any kind of philosopliic progress in his 
doetrine.2 For Anaximancler's notion of infinite matter 
is too indct.e1·minate to f:xplain particular substances, 
and the ' Sfparation ' by ,vhich he accounts for all pro­
duction of the derived from the original, is open to the 
same charge. The determinate substances, according 
to him) are not as 8nch contained in the primitive sub-
1 Striimpcll, therefore, in 
1ilacing A1iaximencs before An:u:i­
mandcr, is e.s little in accordance 
with the intta·nal ,·elation of their 
doctrines, as with the chronology.

stance: separation is therefore only another expression 
for the Becoming of the particular. Anaximenes at­

cess, by wLich thing·s are evolved from primitive matter; 
and to that eud, he sQught-the primitive matter itself' 
in a determiwtte borly, qualified to be the substratum of 
that process. Such an attempt was certainly of greut 
importance; and, considering· the state of enquiry at 
that period, marked real progre~s. On this account; 
the latter Ionian phy~ici~t.s especially folbwr;d Anaxi­
menes ; to such an extent. indeed, that Aristotle at­
tributes the doctrine of rarefaction awl condensation 
to all those who take a determinate substance for their 
principle ; 1 aud a ceutury aftt>r Anaximeues, Diogenes

peculiar nature of 11is philosophy sep!lrntes him from

definitions. This is olear from the subsequent app1;;ar­

philosophers wham we have to mention in this connec­

either the air itself, Ol' a body of the naturn of air, their 
primitive matter. Rut the doctrine of Thales likewise 
found adherents ; for example, Hippo,1 n physicist of the

Hippo was charged with atheism,4 as he bas been in 
several quarters. The unfavourable judgmcnt of Aris­

reconciles us to the meagreness of the traditions respect­

284 IDAE[IS. 
As Hippo was influenced by Thales, so Idaeus of 
Himcra appears to have been influenced by Anaximenes. 1 
Anaximenes most likely also originated the two theories 
mr.ntfoned in some passages by Aristotle ; 2 according 
tq the one, primitive matter i:u respect of demity stands 
midway between water and ,~ir ; according to the other, 
l1etwcen air and fire. That both theories belong to a 
younger generation of Ionian physicist:: is probable, for 
they occupy an intermediate position between older 
philosophers; the one between Thales and Anaximenes, 
the other between Anaximeues and Heradeitu;,. 1V c 
must, however, primarily refer them to An~ximenes; 
,,incc he was the fir~t who raised the question of the 
relative density of the different kinds of matter, and 
who explained the formation of particular substances 
by t.he processes of condenscttion and rarefaction. Iii 
this way he anived at the opposition of rarefied and 
condensed air, or warm air and cold air; if warm air 
were adopted as the primitive element, the result. was 
an intermediary between air and fire; if cold air, an 
intermediary between air and water.3

veloped ideas had been introduced into it. On onA side 
he if; closely connet.:ted with Anaximenes, on another he 
in all prob3 bility tramcerids him: not only is his expo­
sition more methodical in form rnld more careful as to 
detail~, but he i~ also distinguished from his predecessor 
in having ascribed to the air, as primiti\·e cause and 
primitive matter, ccrlain spiritual qualities, and having 
tried to explain the life of the soul by the air so appre­
hended. To gain a fixed basis for his enquiry,' he 
determined the general charncteristics ,vhich mmt 
belong to the primitive essence. On the one hand he 
said it must be the common matter of all things, and 
on the other, an essence capable of thought. His 
argument fm- the first assertion m1s the following. '\V c 
know that things change one into another, that sub~ 
stances mix, and that things influence and affect each 
other. None of theae phenomena would l>e possible if 
the various bodies were distinct as_ to their essence. 
They mu~t therefore be one and the same, must have 
sprung from the same substance, and mmt be resolved 
into the same aga.i.n. 2 In proof of the second assertion,

THE PRH!ITIVE ESS1i1.-VCE. 287 
Diogenes appealed in a general manner to the wfae auu 
felicitous distribution of matter in the world; 1 and 
more particularly, to this tfistimon y of our experienc1-i­
that life and thought are produced in all living natures 
by the air which they breathe, and are bound up with 
this substance.2 Ho therefore concluded that the 
substance of whid1 all things consfot must be a body 
eternal, unelrnng·cablc, great and powerful, and rich in 
knowledge.3 All these qualities he thought be di~­
covered in the air ; for the air penetrate~ all t,bings, 
and in mAn and animals produces life and con;cions­
ness; the seed of animalR, also, is of a nature like air.4 
He, therefore, with Anaximencs, declared air to be the 
matter and grouud of all things." This is atte~ted 
almrn,t unanimously 6 by ancient writers ; and Diogenes 
hirn~elf ~ays 1 that air is the c.,scncc in which reason 
genes ix. 57, say6 he bught-viz. 
th"t nothing comes from nothing 
or to nothing-is here indeed pre­
~upposcd, but whether he exp~o.s.sly 
enunciat6d this p~inciple we do not

its nuture is to ~pread itself eYerywhere, to order all

Diogenes as his first principle the substance intermediate

This i~ unquestionably :m error, into which they were

analogy with which he defines his primitive essence,4 
was of the natnre of warm air, Nor can I agree with 
Ritter's similar thcory,5 that the prjmitive essence of 
Diogenes was not the ordinary atmospheric air, but a 
more subtile kind, ignited by heat; for not only do all 
the accounts, and Diogenes' own exphmations, speak of 
the air as ' that which is usually called air;' but accord­
ing to his own principles it would have been impossible 
for him, wbilc deriving a11 things from air by rare­
faction and condemation, to seek the original principle 
( that which comtituted the basfo of all the rliffr:rent

common aerial element, lint in sorne pii.rticular kind of 
air.1 Schleiermacher's conjecture also 2 is improbable, 
that Diogenes himself held uir to be the primitive 
matter, but that Aristotl!'l was doubtful as to lib mean­
ing, and so ascribed to him sometimes the air in 
general, sometimes warm or (:Old ufr. Such hesitation 
on the part of Aristotle respecting the principles of 
his predecessors is without precedent; from his whole 
spirit and method it is far more likely that he lllay 
have sometimes reduced the indefinite notions of earlier 
philosophers to definite concepts, than that he shonld 
have expressed himHelf in a vacillating and uncertain 
manner in regard to their de-finite theories. Aristotle 
repeatedly and decidedly declares that the principle of 
Diogene~ was air ; he then speaks of somo philosophers, 
without naming· them, whose principle was intermediate 
between air and water. Now it is impossible that these 
statements can relate to the same persons ; we cannot 
doubt, therefore, that it is air in the common accepta~ 
tion of the word, which ou:r philosopher maintains to be 
the essence of all things. 
We :find from the above quotations that Diogenes, 
in his more precise description of the air, a~c:ribed to it 
two properties which correspond to the rnquirements

claimed by him in general for the primal matter. As 
the substance of all things, it must be eternal and 
imperisb:a"ble, it must be contained in all things, and 
permeate all tl1ings; as the cause of life and order in 
the world, it must he a thinking and reasonable essence. 
In the air these two aspects am united; for, according 
to Diogenes' view, bec@J.se the n.ir permeates all things, 
it is that which guides and orders them; because it is

the rarest and sHbtlest matter, it is the most movable, 
and the cause of all motion. L We are expressly told 2 
that he !>poke of the air as the Infinite, and the state­
ment is the more credible, since Anaximenes, whom 
Diog'enes in other respects follows most closely, employed 
a similar definition. Moreover Diogenes describes the 
air in the same way that Anaximander describes his 
£rrsipov; and Aristotle say,: that the infinity of primi­
tive matter was held by moHt of the physiologists.3 
But this definition seems to have been regarded hy him 
as of minor importance compared with the life and 
force of the primitive essence; that is his main point, 
and in it he dbcovers the chief proof of its air-like 
natnrc. 
On account of this vitality and constant motion} 
the uir assumes the mo~t various forms. Its motion 
consists, according to Diogenes ( who here again follows

particular suhstances with the innumerabfo stages of 
rarefaction and condensation, so that the nir would 
hecome at one stage of condensation water, at another 
flesh, at a third stone. The most probable supposifion, 
however, and t-he one which seems to result from the 
a hove statements of his about the different kinds of air, 
and also from his opinion on the development of tJie 
fretns ( vide inf1•a )-is that he employed neither of the 
two mode~ of explication exclusiyely, and, generally 
:-peaking, in the derivation of phenomena, followed no 
fixed and uniform method. 
'l'he first result of condensation and rarefaction was 
t.o separate from the infinite primitive substance, the 
heavy matter which moved dowm'lin-ds, and the light 
matt.er which moved upward8. From the former the 
earth was produced; from the latti-;r, the sun, and no 
' doubt the stars also} This motion npwards and down­
wards Diogenes was forced to derive in the first place 
f10m heaviness and lightness, and secondlyi from the 
inherent animation of matter as such. For the moving 
intelligence with him absolutely coincides with matter; 
the different kinds of air are also different kinds of 
thought (Fr. 6); that thonght was added to material 
substances, and set them in rnotion,2 is a view which 
would have been impossible to him. But after the first 
division of ,;ubstances has been accomplished, all motion 
proceeds from the warm and the light.3 Diogenes ex­
plained the soul of animals to be warm air; and so in

held the sun and stars2 to be porous bodies, of a fonua­
tion like pumice stone, the hollows of "hich aJ'e filled 
with fire or fiery air.3 The theory of the origin of the 
stars from moist exhalations/ in connection with that 
just quoted from Alexander on the growth of the 
heavens by the evapomtions of the earth, would lead 
u;:; to conjecture that Diogenes supposed the sun alone 
to have been at first formed from the wan.it air drawn 
upwards, and the ,;tars to have afterwards arisen from 
the vapours evolved by the sun's heat, hy which vapours 
the sun himself was thought to have been continually 
imstained. As this nourishment is at times exhausted 
in each part of the world, the. sun (so at least Alexander 
represents the doctrine of Diogenes) changes hi~ place,

Diogenes s11ared with Anaxagoras and other ·phy­
Elicists the belief that living creatures 1 and likewise 
plants 2 were prodnced out of the earth, no doubt by the 
influence of the sun's heat. In an rmalogo1L~ manner 
he explained the process of generation, by the influence 
of the vivifying heat of the body of the mother on the 
seed.3 In accordance with his 1?;eneral standpoint, he 
thonght the soul to be a wtlJ'm, dry air. As the air is 
capable of endless diversity, souls likewise are as various 
as the kinds and individual natures to which they 
belong.~ Thfa suhstance of the soul he appears to have 
derived partly from the secd,5 and partly from the onter 
air entering the lnng~ after birth; 6 and its warmth, 
according to the above theory, from the warmth of t.he 
mother. 'l'he diffusiou of life throughout the whole body 
. he expfaincd by the theory that the soul or warm vital 
·1 air streams along with the blood through the veins.7 In

ascribed something analogous to respiration to metals) 
supposing them to abs01·b damp vapours (fKµc1s), and 
to exude them ag,1in, and thus seeking to explain the 
attractive power of the magnet} Only animals, how­
ever, he considered, can breathe the air as such. Plants 
are entirely irrational, for the reason that they do not 
breathe it.2 
Like Anaximander and Aua.x:iwenes, Diogenes is 
said to have assumed the perpetual alternation of the 
world's construction and destruction, and an endless 
number of succesfr,lc worlds. Simpliciuss expressly 
says this, and the statement that Diogenes believed in 
an infinity of worlds4 must have reference to it, for his 
whole cosmogony showB, even mme clearly than the 
assertion of Simplicius (loo. cit. )," that he could only 
conceive the totality of simultaneous tl1ings as one 
whole limited in space. Stobreu;; 6 speaks of a future 
end of the world, and Alcxander,7 of a gradual drying 
up of the sea, whii::h mnst both have asimilar reference; 
and even without thi;; explicit teiitimony, we must have 
supposed Diogenes on this point, likewise, to have Leen 
in agreement with his predecessors. 
In considering his theory as a whole, we must allow 
that notwithstanding its superiority to the previous phi­
losophic theories in Rcient-ific and lite:-ary form, and in

a contradiction involved in it5 fundamental conceptio11S. 
If the orderly constitution of the world is only to be 
understood in reference t1J a world-forming reason, l11b 
presnpposes that matter as such dof's not suffice to 
ex.plain it; its canse cannot therefore be sought, in mie 
clcrnentary body, and so Diogenes is forct:d to w::cribe 
to this body qualities whicb not merely from our point 
of ·view, but absolutely and directly, exclude one 
another; for on Lhc one haml Im describes it as the 
subtlest and rarest, because it is the all-permeating 
and all-animating, and on the other, he makes things 
a.rise from it, not only by condensation, but also by 
rarefa.ctimi, which would be impossible if the primitiYe 
element were it~elf the mrt:st in cxistence.1 That it is 
not mernly 2 the warm air, or the soul, hut air in general 
that Diogenes calls the ra.rest, we are at auy rate clearly 
told by Adstotle,3 who rnys that Diogeues held the soul 
to be air, becau_se air is the rarest element and the 
primitive matter; and Diogenes himself (Fr. 6) sap 
that the air is in all things, and perwe11tes all things, 
which could not be unless it were itself the subtlest 
element. Nor can r~trefaetion ~ refer to a secondary 
form of air arising from previous condensation ; for the 
ancient philosophers, with one accord, attribute the 
power of rarefaction, as well as condensation, to primi­
tive matter ; Ii and this indeed lies in the nature of

things, for rarnfaction and condensation mutually 
presuppose each other, and a condensation of one 
portion of a body of air is impossible without the 
simultaneous rarefaction of another. Thus, there is 
a contradiction in the bases of the sy~tem, resulting 
from the fact that its author adopted the idea of a. 
·world-forming reason, without therefore abandoning tbe 
ancient Ionian materialism, and especially the theories 
of Anax.imenes on primitive matter. 
This circumstance would in itself lead us to con­
j ecturc that Diogenes' theory did not wholly arise tmt 
of the developmeut of the ancient Ionian physics, bnt 
under the influence of another philosophy, having a 
different st:mdpoint ; arn.l that contmdictory elements 
bad lhcrefore appeared in it. This conjecture becomes 
still more proba.ble when ,ve see, contemporaneonslywith 
Diogenes, the very definitions which contradict his 
materialistic presuppositions, brought forward by Anax­
agoras in connection with a more logical doctrine.

HIS HISTORICAL POSITION. 301 
he appeared later than Anaxagoras, ancl wrote in partial 
dependence upon him. The oan:,fnlnPei-: of Diogenes in 
regard to the details of natural seience, and c~pecially 
the great precision of his anatomical knowledge, would 
assign him to a period whou obserrntion had made 
some advances: the period of a Hippo and a Democritns.1 
In tlte same way we drnll find re;1wn to suppose him 
later than Empcdoclcs. On these grounds some de­
pendence of Diogenes on Ana:rngoras seews probable, 
and the internal evidence of their doctrines is wholly in 
fayom of this view. The ~hiking simiJarity between 
them makes it hardly credible that tJrnse doctrine,; 
should have been produued independently of each other.~ 
Not only Jo Diogenes and Anaxagoras both require a. 
\-rorld-forming rea;;(m, but they require it on the same 
ground, that the order of the universe was otherwise 
inexplicable to them: both de~crihe this reason as the 
subtlest of all thing,,; both derive the Rtml and life 
essentially from it.3 \Ve cannot, however, consider 
Anaxagoras as dependent on Diogenes, and Diogenes as 
the historical link between him and the older physicists.~ 
in Cic. N. D. i. 12, 29, his name 
comes last among all the pre~So­
eratic philosophers.

302 DIOGENE8 OP AI'OLLONIA. 
Schleiennacher indeed thinks that had Diogenes been 
acquainted with the w01·k of Anaxagoras, he mn,t have 
expressly opposed Anaxagoras' theory that the air is 
something composite; but in the first place we have no 
evidence to show that he did not oppose it ; 1 and in 
the second \>'e l1avc no right to apply the standards of 
modern philosophy t.o the method,, of the anciei1ts, nor 
to expect from these latter a profound investig,1tion of 
throries differing from their own, rnuh as even a Plato 
did not always impose upon himself. The main prin­
ciple of Aua::rngorns, however, the sep%ratfou of the 
organising rea.son from matter, Diogenes seems to me 
dearly enongh to oppose, in his 6th Fragment.2 
Schlciermachel' indeed finds no tnv~e in the ·pa~sagc 
of any polemic of this kind, but merely the tone of a 
per3on who is newly introducing the doctrine of vou5'; 
but the cam with which Diogenes dt:woustrates that all 
the qualities of intelligemie belong to the air, gives me 
the opposite impression. In the same way it seems to 
me t.hat Diogenes 3 is so careful to prove the unlhink­
ableness of ~e.-eral primitive subsb.1.nces, because he had 
been preceded by some philosopher who denied the 
unity of the primitive matter. That he is alluding to 
Empedocles only, and not to Anaxag;oras,4 is improbable, 
considering the many othf;r voints of contact between 
Diogenes and Anaxagoras. If, however, he had Empe­
docles chiefly in view, that alone would show him to he

HIS IIISTORIC'AL POSITION ;103 
a younger contemporary of Anaxagorn.s, and his philo­
sophy might he supposed to have appeared at a later 
date than that of Arnuag-oras. Schleiermacher con­
siders it more natural that spirit should first have bcmi'. 
disco1·ered in its union with llllttter, trn.d aftl;!rwards in 
opposition to it; but this is hardly conclusive in regard 
to Anaxagoras's relation to Diogene,:;; for the direct, 
unity of spirit with matter, which was the starting point 
of the elder phy.,icists, we do not find in Diogenes ; on 
the co11trnry, he introduces thought, because the purely 
physical explanation of phenomena does not satisfy him. 
But if t.he importance of thonc"ht has once been re­
cognised, it is cerfa11nly more probable that the new 
principle Rhould be first set up in abrupt opposition to 
material canscs, than that it should be combined with 
them in so uncertain a manner as by Diogenes.1 The 
whole question is deciderl by this fact, that tbe con­
ception of a world-fonning l'eason is only logically 
carried out by Anaxagoras ; Diogenes on the contrar.r 
attempts to combine it in a contradictory manner, with 
a standpoint entirely oat, of harmony with it. This in­
decisive sort of eclecticism is much more in keeping 
with tbe younger philosopher, who desires to make use 
of the new ideas without renouncing the old, than with 
the philosopher to "l\hom the new ideas belong as his 
original possession,2 Diogenes is therefore, in my

opinion, an adherent of the old Ionian physics, of the 
school of Anaximenes; sufficiently affected by the 
philowphic discovery of Anaxagoras to attempt a com­
bination of his ( Anaxagoras') doctrine; with that of 
Anaximenes, but for the most part folfowing A1iaximenes 
in his principle n,nd the application of it. That there 
would be a Tctrngrade rnovcmcnt,1 according to this 
view, from Anaxagoras to Diogeues proves nothing; 
for historical progress in general docs not exclude re­
trogression as to particulars : 2 that Anaxagoras, on the 
other hand, cannot be immediately related to Ana:x:i­
mfones3 is true ; but we have no Tight to condude from 
this that Diogenes (rather than Heracleitus, the Elea­
tics or the Atomists) forms the connecting liuk between 
them. Lastly, though the theory of the oµornµiopij may 
be a more artificial conception than the docb·ine of 
Diogenes,4 it by no weans follows that it must be the 
more recent; it is quite conceivable, on the contrary,. 
that the very difficulties of the Anaxagorean expla­
nation of natme may have had the effect of confirmiug 
Diogenes in his adhercnee to the more simple and 
ancient Ionic doctrine. The same might be con­
jectured in regard to the dualism of the principles 
professed Ly Anaxagoras ; 5 and thus we must regard 
woll have borrowed them from the 
uther. But Diogeues' explanation 
of the sensuous percBption, at any 
rats, showM a developmcct of th~ 
docttice of Acaxagoms (vide Phi­
lippson, "T/1.,i cw~pr,.,1tl/t"II, 199), and 
his superiority i'! empirical know· 
ledge marks him rather as a oon· 
temporary of Democritus than a 
predecessor of Anaxagora.s. In his

t,i follow Empedodes.

the theory of Diogenes as the attempt of a later philo­
sopher, partly to save the physical doctrine of Anaxi­
menes and Uw earlier Ionians ,1s against the innovation:, 
of Anaxagoras, and partly to combine them with each 
other.1 
However noteworthy this attempt may he, the 
philosopliir; imporbwl:e of it cannot be rauked very 
high ; 2 the cl1icf merit of Diogenes seems to consist in 
his having enlarged the rauge of the empirical know­
ledge of nature, and laboured to prove more completely 
the life and teleological. constitution o{ 1mture in de­
tail. But these idm1s were the111~elve,; supplied to him 
by his pre.decessors, Ana:.agoras and tbe ancient phy­
sicists. Greek philosophy, as a whole, had in the ti.rne 
of Diogenes long· since struck out paths that conducted 
it far beyond the point of the earlier Ionian physic~.3

Hligbter and more cautious tlmn the ,mbsequcut tradi­

already taken posRession of Pythagoras and his personal 
history; and that the hter Peripatetics had begun to de­
velop the Pythagorean r1octrines according to their famy. 
These sources ( of which it is true we possess only 
fragments) give us scarcely a single detail which we 
dig not already know through Aristotle. Farther de­
velopments of the Pythagorean legend, which relate, 
however, rather to the history of Pythagoras and hiK 
1'.chool, than to their doctrines, appear <luring the third 
and s0conrl centuries, in the statements of Epicurus, 
'l'im::cus, N eanthes, IIermippus, Hieronymus, Hippo­
liotus, and others. But it was not 1rntil the time of 
the Neo-Pythagoreans, when Apollonius of Tyar1a wrote 
his Life of Pythagoras, when Moderatns compiled a 
long and detailed work on the Pythagorean Philosophy, 
when "N"icomaclmt t.reated the theory of nmnbers and 
ibcology in accordance with the principles of his own 
scLool~that the authorities concerning Pythagoras and 
his doctrines bc·came copions enough to make such 
cxpositiom as those of Porphyry and Iamblic1ms pos­
sible.2 Thus the tradition respecting Pytlwgorcanism

:JlO THE PYTHA(JOREA .. YS, 
expressly deny that they held, and claim as their o,'l'n 
personal di~covel'ies ? The so-called Pythagorean doc­
ti-ines which are not acknowlerlged as such by ancient 
ttuthorities are Neo-Pythagorean, and the miraculous 
tales and improbable combinations with which Pytha­
gorean history is so largely adorned in the later autbor~1 
no doubt in great part emanate from the same sonrcc. 
But if the untrustworthy and nnhistorical character 
of these expositions is :in the main indispntu ble, we 
caunot venture to make use of the statements they 
contain, even where those 8tatemcnts are not in them­
selves opposed to historic,il probability, and to the more 
ancient and trn~tworthy authorities; for how can we, in 
regard to minor particulars, trust the assertions of those 
who have pos.s1y dt'eeived us in the most important 
matteTs ? In all cases therefore where the later au­
thorities, subsequent to the appeamnce of Neo-Pytha­
goreism, are unsupported by · other testimony, their 
statements may generally be supposed to rest, not on 
real knowledge or credible tradition, but on dogmatic 
presuppositions, party interests, uncertain legend8, 
arbitrary inventions, or falsified writings. Even the 
agreement of several suc11 authorities cannot prove 
much, as they are accustomed to transcribe one from 
the other without ar,y preliminary criticism; 1 their 
assertions merit attention only in cases where they may 
either be directly referred to older sources, or where 
their internal nature j 11stifics us in the belief thut they 
aro founded on historical tradition.

What has just been said in regard to t-he indirect 
authorities for the Pythagorean doctrine, equally ap­
plies to the so-called dircd sources. Later writers, 
belonging almost without exceptiOJn to the Xeo-Pytha­
gorean and Neo-Platonic period, spe-dk of an extensive 
Pythagorean literature, the nature and compa~s of 
which we may gather not only from t.he fow writings 
we possess, but far more from the numcrons fragments 
'1hich exist of lost works.1 .A very small fraction, 
howeycr, of those writings m:,y with any probability be 
ascribed to the ancient Pythagorean school. Had this 
school possessed such a mass of written works, it would 
be hard to understand why the ancient authors should 
not contain IDOJre distinct allu~ions to them, and es­
pecially why Aristotle g}10nld be so entirely silent as 
to Pythagoras' own doctrine/ when several of these

ence, but that until the time of Philolaus they were 
strictly preserved as secret by the school, but this asser­
tion can have no weight against the evidence we have 
just cited; it is rather indeed a coufirmation of the fact -
tha.t the later writers themselves could find no authen­
tic traces of the existence of Pythagorean writings 
previous to Philolaus. When, therefore, the savants of 
the Alexandrian or Roman period presuppose that snch 
writings mnst always have existed, at any rate witl1in 
the Pythagorean school, ~hi~ theory is entirely based on 
the assertions of the so-called ancient works themselves, 
and on the opinions of a generation which could form 
no idea of a philosophic school without philosophic 
literature, became it was itself accustomed to get its 
science from books. .;\Toreover, the internal evidence 
of most of these reputed Pythagorean fragments is 
strongly against their authenticity. The greater 1mm­
ber of i:he fragments of Philolaus indeed, as Bi.ickh bas 
shown in his excellent monograph, 1 must certainly be 
comidered genuine, not merely on the score of external 
testimony, but also, and far more because in content 
anc.i mode of expression they agree with one another, 
and are in harmony with all that we know from well 
authenticated sources as Pythagorean ; there iH only

to their form and content,' can only serve to strengthen 
our susp1c10n. Opinions arc likewise unanimous as 
to the :;puriousness of the treatise on the 'N orld-soul, 
attributed to Timmus of Leeds, but obviously an extract 
from the Timams of Plato. The demom:t:ration of Ten­
nemann 2 in regard to this is amply sufficient. As to· 
Ocellus of Lrniania, and his work on the universe, the 
only question can be whether m· not the work itself 
claims to be of aI1cient Pythagorean origin ; for that it 
is not, is perfectly evident. lt.s latest editor, however, 
rightly maintains that the work claims for its anthor 
the so-called PyLhagorPan, to whom fWcient writers with

number have preponderating evidence against them; 
and those which may he considerer] authentic can n.dd 
little to our knowledge of the Pythagorean philosophy 
as a whole, belonging as they do chiefly to mathematics, 
or other specific branches of enquiry.1 This judgment 
b not to be set aside by ihc fact that Petersen,2 in 
order to explain the undeniably Platonic element in 
the so-called books of Archybts, regards him as having­
anticipated the Platonic doctrine of Ideas, and Beck­
mann i makes him out in this re$pect a diRciple of 
Plato; for not a single ancient authority nlludc:s to 
this prc:tc:ndcd l'latonism of Archyta~. vVhere the rela­

described as a Pythagorflan, and that not only by the 
more recent writers subsequent to Cicero's time,t but 
even as early as Aristoxenus,2 whose acquaintance with 
the later Pytliagureans is beyond question ; indeed 
Archytas clearly calls himself a Pythagorean/ in a 
fragment the authenticity of which can ~can~ely he 
disputetl.4 It is true that the School of Archytas is 
also mentioned as an indepe11deut school/ but that 
does not disprove our the~is. This school is a~ much a 
Pythagorean school a~ that of XenocratP.s i~ Platonic, 
or that of 'l'heop hm~tns Peripatetic. If, however, 
Arcbytas was a Pythagon,an, he cannot have been at

322 THE PYTHAGOREANS. 
for it is not merely impossible to prove 1 that this 
doctrine was known to Uie Pythagoreans, hut Aristotle's 
evidence is most distinctly to the contrary.2 Since 
therefore in the fragments of the so-called Arcbytas we 
encounteT Platonic as well as Peripatetic doctrines and 
expressions, we must consider these a sure sign of a 
later origin, and consequently reject by far the greater 
number of the fragments. Even supposing t.he modem 
case for their defence were successful) they could not be 
1·egardcd as records of the Pythagorean doctrines ; for 
if they can only be rescued by making their author a 
Platonist, we cannot be snre in any given case how far 
they reproduce the Pythagorean point of view. 
A contemporary of Archytas, LysiH the Tareutine, 
has latterly been conjectured by ~:[uI1ach :, to be th~ 
author of the so-called Golden Poem; but the corrupt 
passage in Diogenes viii. 6 4 is no evidence for this, and 
t.hc work itself is so colourless and disconnected, that it 
looks rather like a later collection of practical precepts, 
some of which lmd perhaps been long in circulation in 
a metrical form.~ In any case, however, it does uot 
' Plato's 11tterances in the Su· 
phist, 2-H;l sqq. cann0t, as Petersen 
(loo. ~it.} ;1nd Mallet ( Ecole ae 
.MJgare, liii. sq.) believe, relate to 
the later Pythagoreans (d. ii. a.. 
215 sq.), and the polemic of Aris­
totle's Metap!!,11$io.S agaias~ 11 n11m­

materially contribute to our knowledge of the Pythn­
gorean philosophy. 
In regard to the remaining fragments, with few 
and unimportant exceptions, those which bear the n;unes 
of well-known ancient I>ythagOTeans, such as Thetmo, 
Brontinus, Clinias, and :Ecphantus, are certainly spur­
iom. l\fost of them, however, are attributed to men 
of whom we either know nothing at a.11, or arc ignorant 
when they lived. But as these fragmcnLs prcciwly 
resemble, the re~t in their content and expo,ition, we 
cannot doubt that they too ch\im to be of ancient 
Pythagorean origin. If they have no imch origin, they 
must be comiden,d deliberate forgerie$, and not the 
genuine proclnctions of a later l'ythagoreanism 0,pproxi­
mating to tlie Platonic or Peripatetic philosophy. 
JHorcovcr, the later Pythagoreanisrn which professes to 
be older than Neo-Pythagoreanism, has been altogether 
deri ve<l frolll these fragmenbi, whereas all historical evi­
dence agrees that the laie3L ramifications of the ancient 
Pythagorean School do not cl:tcnd beyond the time of 
Aristotle. In truth, few or no elements of ancient 
Pylhagoreanism are to be fmmcl ·in these nnmerous 
passage~. Of the3e fragments and of the other vestiges 
of Pytbagoreanism, so much as claims our attention 
from a philosophic point of view will be treated further

Iamblichus may have borrowed 
t.hem from Apollonius (of Tyan3), 
but m"en if this wore tr,1e, we must 
s~ill a,k where Apolloniusobtaiuetl

of th~ SO· called Crotoniau momoi1·s 
un which Apollonins (ap. fombl.

Lhe statement must be discarlled ; 
that ntca,mchus does not here de·

writers-cannot be satisfactorily established. The most 
ancient evidence for this journey, that of Isocrates, is 
more than . a hundred and fifty years later than the 
event to which it refers, and moreover is contained, 
not in a historical work, but in a rhetorical oration 
which itself makes no pretension to bistorical credi­
bility.1 Such testimony has obviously no weight at 
all"; and even if Isocrntes did not himself originate 
the idea that Pythagoras had been in Egypt, there 
would still remain the doubt whether the source from 
which he took it was grounded on historical tradition. 
This, howe\'e1', is not only beyond the reach of proof, 
but is contrary to all 11robabiliLy. Herodotus, it is 
true, remarks on the analogy of one Pythagoreau u~age 
with a custom of the Egyptians; 2 he also says that the 
he ,;cys (i. 4!>) that 1 declare it 
certain that PythAgoras uev~r wont

journeys of Pythagoras in the East ; our authorities 
become more copious as we recede from the philoso­
pher's own time, and more meagL'e as we approaeh it; 
before the beginning of the fourth century they entirely 
fail. Each later writer has more to tell than his pre­
decessor; and in proportion as the acquaintance of the 
Greelrn with the Orfo11tal civilised nations increases, 
the extent of the journeys which brought the Samian 
philosopher to be inst.meted by them likewise increases. 
This is the way that legends are formed and not his­
torical tradition. \Ve cannot, indeed, pronounce it im­
possible that Pythagoras should have gone to Egypt or 
Phcenicia, or even to Babylon, but it is on that account 
all the more indemonstrable. The ,vhole character 
of the narmtives of his journey;; st,rengthem the sup­
position that, as they now stand, they can have been 
derived ·frow no historical reminiscence; that it was not 
the definite knowledge of his intercourse with foreign 
nations which gave rise to the theories as to the origin 
of his doctrine; but, conversely, the presupposition of 
the foreign source of his doetrine which occasioned the 
stories of 1iis interconrge with the barbarians There 
is quite enough to account for such a presupposition, 
even if it were founded ·ou no actual contemporary 
tradition, in the syncretism of later times, in the false 
pragmatism 1 which could only explain the similarity of 
Pythagorean doctrines and usages with those of the 
East by the theory of personal relations between Py­
thagoras and the Orienta!R, and in the tendency to

panegyric of the Pythagorean legend which loved to 
concentrate the wisdom of the whole human race in 
its hrro.1 The statement that Pythagoras vi,ited Crete 
and Sparta, partly to become acquainted with the laws 
of those couuLries, partly th,1t he might be initiated 
iuto the my~teries of the ld:oean Zeus, stands on no 
better fonndation.2 The thing is in itself conccivaLle, 
but the evidence is too uncertain, and the probability 
of any historical tradition as to these details too scanty 
to allow of our placing any trust in the assertion. So, 
too, the theory that the philosopher owed his wi,dom 
to Orphic teachers 3 end writings, even though it may 
not be wholly wrong as to the fact, is doubtless based, 
as it stands, not on any hiBtorical reminiscence, but on 
the. pn,suppositions of a period in \l'bicb an Orphic 
theosophy and 1itemtnre harl fom1ed ilself to some 
extent under Pythagorean and Nco-Pythagorean in­
flnenccs. The truth i~, that we possess no document 
which des1;:rves to be considered a historical tradition 
concerning the education of Pythagoras and the re­
sources at his command. Whether it be possible to 
supply tbis want by inferences from the int-0rnal nature 
of the Pytbagorean doctrine, ·we shall enquire liter on.

than conjecture the reasons which led to it.2 His

to bear it out.4 Heracleitns soon after the death 
of this philosopher speaks of his various knowledge

PYTHAGORAS DI' ITALJ:~ :l37 
the spread of Italian Pythagol'eani,;m was hrong-ht 
about by the dispersion of the Pythagoreans long after 
the death of the master. Again, the well-known and 
often cinoted narratiyc of Zalmox:is I presupposes that 
Pythagoras had already played the same part in bis 
own country that he afterwards played in Magna Grrecia. 
In this story a GIBtic divinity takes the form of a 
man and communicates with Pythagoras. The motive 
of that fiction eYidently is to explain the pn:~mned 
similarity of the Gretic belief in immortality with 
the Pythagorean doctrine ( vide supra, p. 7 3, l) ; yet 
the story could never ba\•e been invented if the name 
of the philosopher had been unknown to the Gre€'b on 
the Hellespont, from whom Herodotus recei1,cd it, and 
if in tbeir opinion his activity had firat commenced 
in Italy. Whether among his countrymen he found 
less appreciation than he had hoped for, or ,vhether 
other reasons, such a:;; the tyranny of i-3olycrates or the 
fear of the Persian iiwasion, hacl disgusted him with 
his native city, in any case he left it a~d took up his 
abode in Crotona, a city with which be may possibly 
have had some personal connections, and which may 
well have commended itself to him on account of the 
far-famed salubrity of its site and the vigorous activity 
of its inlmbitants.2 Here he found the prnper soil for-

its dispersion so exclusively associatfod with lower Italy, 
that it h often described as the Italian school.1 
But this portion of his life is still so much obscured 
by fabulous legends that it is hard to discover anything 
with a historical foundation in the mass of pure in· 
vention. If we may believe our informants, even the 
person of Pythagoras was surroundP-d with miraculous 
splendour. A favourite, and even a reputed son, of 
Apollo,2 he is said to have been revered by bis followers

How much of these statements may ue aC'cepted as 
historical it is difficult to determine in detail; we can 
only establish appro.:dmatdy certaill general results. 
Vle see that so early as the time of Atistotle, Aristoxe­
uus, and Dictearchus, many miraculous tales respecting 
Pythagoras were in circulation ; but whether he 4iwself 
appeared in the charnder of a worker of miracle~ 
cannot be a6certained. The manner in whir:h he is 
spoken of by Empedoclcs and Heracleitus I renders it 
probable that, for long after hfa death, he was merely 
esteemed as a man of unusual wisdom, without any super­
natural character. This wisdom seems to have been 
chiefly of a religious kind, and to have served religious 
ends. Pythagoras appears as the founder of a religiuus 
association wfrh its own rites and ceremonies; thus he 
may have pas,;ed for a seer and a priest, and may have 
declaL"ed himself as such : this is extremely likely 
from the whole character of the Pyt.hagorcan legend,

and from the existence of Pythagorean orgies in the 
fifth century; but that does not make him by any 
means the extrabrdinary phenomenon presupposed by 
the later tradition ; he merely stands in the same 
category with Epimenides, Ononmcritus, and other men 
of the sixth and seventh centuries. Fnrther, it seems 
certain that the Pythagorean society distinguished 
itself above all other similar associations by its ethical~ 
tendency; but we can get no true idea of its ethical 
aims and institutions from the later untrustworthy 
authorities. Pythagoras doubtless entertained the 
design of founding a school of piety and morality, 
temperance, valour, order, obedience to government 
and law, fidelity to friends, and generally for the en~ 
couragement of all virtues belonging to the Greek, and 
particularly to the Doric conception of a good and brave 
man; virtues which are particularly insisted ml in the 
sentences attributed with more or less probability to 
Pythagoras. For this purpose he appealed first to the 
religious motives which resulted from the belief in the 
dominion of the godi;, and especially from the doctrine 
of transmigration; then he had recourse to the educa­
tional methods and usages of his native country, such 
as music and gymnastics. We are assured by the most 
trustworthy traditions that these two arts were zealously 
practised in the Pythagorean school, With tl,Jese may 
have been also connected ( v'ide supra) the use 9'f cer­
tain therapeutic and secret remedies. Incantation, song, 
and religious music probably played the part attributed 
to them in the myths; this is rendered probable by the 
whole character of the art of medicine in ancient times,

closely allied as it wa.s with religion, sorcery a.nd music; 
while, on the other hand, the statement that the Pytha­
gorean art of medicine consisted mainly of dietetics 1 is 
confirmed, not merely by its connection with gymnastic 
and by the whole character of the Pythagorean mode of 
life, but also 2 by Plato's similar view.3 It is probable 
too, that the Pythagoreans adopted the pradice in their 
society of common meals, either daily or at certain 
times; 4 but what later authors have said about their 
community of goods is certainly fabulous ; and the 
peculiarities ascribed to them concerning dress, food, 
and other habits of life must be reduced to a fow traits 
of little importance.5 Furthermore, although the politi­
cal character of the Pyt.kigorean society is undeniable,. 
yet the assertion 6 that its entire design was of a purely 
political kind, and that every otlH"r end was suborrli­
n:tted to this1 goes far beyond any proofs deducible from 
histo.ry, and is neither compatible with the physical and 
mathematical bent of the Pythagorean science, nor with

the fact that the most ancient authorities represent 
Pythagoras to m rather as a prophet, a wise mau a:ud a 
moral reformer, than as a statesman.• The alliance of 
Pythagoreanism with the Doric aristocracy seems to me 
the consequence and not the reason of its general 
tendency and view of life, and though 1;be tradition 
which bids us recognise in the Pythagorean societies of 
Magna Gr::ccia a political combination may in the 
main be worthy of credit, yet I find no proof that the 
religious, ethical, and scientific character of the Pytha­
goreans was developed from their political bias. The 
contrary seems, indeed, more probable. On tlie other 
hand, it is difficult to admit that scientific inquiry was 
the root of Pythagoreanism. For the moral, religious, 
and political character of the school cannot be explained 
by the theory of numbers and mathematics, iu which, 
as we Rhall presently find, the <listinguishing pecu­
liarities of the Pythagorean science consisted. Pytha~ 
gonianism seems rather to have originated in the moral 
and re:iigious element, which is most prominent in the 
oldest accounts of Pythagoras, and 2.ppe1:Lrs in the 
early PylhiLgorean org'ics, to which aho the sole doctrine 
which can with any certainty be ascribed to Pythagoras 
himsdf-the doctrine of transmigration-relates. Py­
thagoras desired to effect, chiefly by the aid of religion, 
a reform of the moral life; but as in Thales, the first 
physical speculation had connected itself with ethical 
retl.ection, so here practical ends were united with that 
form of Rcicntific theory to which Pythagoras owes his 
place :in the history of philosop11y. Again, iu their

religious rites alone must we seek for the much talked 
of mysteries of the Pythagorean Society. The division 
of esoterie and exoteric ( if this indeed existed among 
the ancient Pythagoreans) was purely a religious dis­
tinction. It resulted from the traditional distinction 
between greater and lesser initiations, between com­
plete and preparatory consecrations.1 That philosophic 
doctrines or even mathematical propositions, apa.rt from 
their possible re1igious symbolism, should have been 
held secret, is in the highest degree improbahle ; ~ Phi­
lolaus at any rate, and the other authorities from whom 
Plaoo and Aristotle derived their knowledge of l'ytha~ 
goreanism, can ha.ve known nothing of any ordinanee 
of this nature. 3 
The political tendency of the Pythagorean com­
munity was fatal to its material existence and to a

Cej',tion of the importai,e~ Qf this

fact that after there appeared a

the original Pytha,gormmism, which 
was limited t-0 religious prescripts

as the opinion of Pyth8t:ora1 what 
they themselves had foisted upon 
him. and t-0 -explain away the enti~e 
silence of ancient tradition on the 
subject. It is only in their writings 
that these two chs&es of Pythag-o­

in opposition to the traditional aristocratic institutions, 
which in time invad0d most of the Greek States, de­
clared itself with remarkable rapidity and energy in 
the populous and independent Italian colonies, in­
habited 11y a mixed population, excited by ambitious

of the aristoc:ratic party: they therefore became the im­
mediate object of a forious persecution which raged 
with the utmost violence throughout lower Italy. The 
meeting houses of the Pythagoreans were everywhere 
burnt; they themselves murdered or banished, and the 
aristocratic constitutions overthrown. This continued 
until at length, through the intervention of the Achreans, 
an agreement was brought aliout by which the re­
mainder of the exiles were allowed to return to their 
homes.1 As to the date and more preci8e details of 
this persecution, accounts differ considerably. On the

Pythagoras died; hut there are so many discrepancies 
as to details, that a complete reconciliation of the 
various statements is impossible. What is most pro­
bable is that the first public outbreak must have taken 
place after the death of Pythagoras, though an opposi­
tion to him and his friends may perhap8 ha,"e ariseu 
during his lifetime, and caused his migration to Meta­
pontum. The party struggles with tbe Pythagoream, 
thus begun, may have repeated them1:1elves at different 
times I in the cities of Magna Gr;.ccia, and the varia­
tions in the statements may be partially-accounted for 
as recollections of these different facts. The burning of 
the assembled Pytbagoreans in Crotona and the general 
assault upon the Pythagorean party most likely did not 
take place until the middle of the fifth century; and, 
lastly, Pythagoras may have spent the last pmtion of 
his life unmolested in Metapontum. 2 
lanJs broke out into opei1 hostility. 
ThB PythagorPa,ns werB dispersed 
duri11g one <of their assemblies, 
then defeated in combat,, and after 
tuh1ous disturbances, tho whole 
Pythagore,m party wa, driven out 
of lhree neighbo,tri,ig citi ~.s by (.he 
judges, who had been corrupted, 
and a distribution of lHncls and re­
mission of debts was dftt.reed. Not 
till afkr many yeetrs did the 
Ach:Bans accomplish the retUIJJ of 
the exiles, of whom about sixty 
CAme htck; but e.-en theso fell in 
an unfortmmtc encrnrnter with the 
Thurians. 8. Lastly, Hermippu~ 
(ap. Diog. viii. 40; ~£. &lwl. in 
Plat. Zoe. cU. ), differing fmm iJ.11 
othor accounts, a<iys that Pythago­
ras wa~ with bi6 frielldS, fighting 
at the head of tl1c AgPigcntiuos 
against the Syracusa.ns, • and was 
killed in flight, while Lhe Pemainde:r 
of the Pythagore>1ns, to the nnmbft 
of thirty-Jh·c, were burned in 
Tarentum. 
1 As is now genemlly suppo8ed, 
according to Bockh. Philo!. l()_ 
s The above B uppoait(onB are 
chiefly based on the following 
grounds: Firstly, by far Uw groa,er

DISPERSION OJ,' THE PYTHAGOREANS. 361 
It was only after the dispersion of the Italian asso­
ciations, and in consequence of this dispersion that the 
must have been pretty firmly e8• 
tablished, since the most improba­
ble expedients were resorted to by 
the authors of these st.atementg to 
reconcile it with their other tbeo­
i'ies. Other accounts ~ay that he 
was pu~ to rloath in Crotonrt or 
Sicily, but this is no doubt, an in 
stance of what 80 often happens in 
regard to Pythagoras-that facts 
about his school, or a portion of 
his school, are tr>rn8forre<l to him 
personally. Secondly, the occ1tsion 
of Pythagoras's retreat to .Mcta­
p,mtnm could not have been the 
jncendiary attack on the asseml;,ly 
at Crotona ; the attack must have 
oe<:mTcd many years after his 
death, Aristoxenus ancl Apullo­
nius say this expressly. Arist9xe­
nus, howeve1•, is the authority 
whom we ~hould mast e::i:poct to 
rnprudnre the Pytlmgoman tm­
dition of his time. With what

RMh, however, thinks it manifestly 
implies " conten1porary record~/ 
and he deduces from them, not 
only the somewhat unimport!tnt

as this i~ maintained ev~n Ly those 
who place that c,vcnt in the lifo­
time of Pythagoras. it must, at 
any rate, be based on an ancient 
and l1niversa1 tradition. Now 
Lysis, at an advanced nge, was the

TBE PYTHAGOREANS. 
Pythagorean philosophy became more widely known in 
Greece, although the Pythagorean rites had previously 
(Crotona, Sybaris, and C,mlonia) 
no opportu11ity for the cu=olida­
tion and maintenance of the new 
institutions borrowed from the 
Achre(lt1S some time (µe-r& TW«s 
xpovous) after the adjnstmeut of 
the .Pythagorean troubles-yet tho 
Acha;an m~di>Ltion could scarcely 
have occnrmd earlier than from 
ten to :fifteen year:; pr~vious to the 
encl oftlw "Pcloponno~ianwnr; b11t 
P(,lybius himself seems to assume 
tlrn.t the troubles to which the 
burning of the Pythag1Jr~&1 ho111;eij 
gave tlw signal, were not ,·ery dis­
tant chl'Onolor:1ically from the in­
tervention of tho AdilI'a.ns. It 
matters not that the Pythagorean 
assern hly which was lmr1ied is 
universally placed in the house 
of 1\liJ,.., and that the authors of 
·the dend a.re also ca.lkd by Ari~­
toxeuns Cylonmns; :for .Milo's 
house may het\·e rema-inoo the meet­
ing place of lhe Pythagureans a.ft er 
the deMh of its own~r. as Ph,Lo's 
gm,den was thnt of tlw Aearlom y; 
awl 'Cyloniotns '"eems, liko .l'ytha• 
goreans, t<.! havo been a party rnmrn, 
which ~m·vived the chief fr~m 
whom it was derived; cf. Aristox. 
loc. Git, 249. Thirdly. It is ne,·cr• 
tholess probable that befom the 
death of Pythagorns, a party ad­
verse to the Pythagol'cans was 
formed by 0Jlon in Orotonil, which 
, party 1n~y ha vc beeI:l 8 ~rengthened 
ru1,.i11ly by the demand for a dil"i­
sion of the conquered lands, and 
by tbo victorious conflict with tbo 
Sybaritt-8; and that thi~ disturb­
ance may ha,e deteHnined Pytha,­
goras lll remo~e tll ]\fotapontum. 
This is admitted bv Arist.oxenus 
and Apollonius, tho~gh the former 
makes th~ burning of l\1ilo's house 
t,;ke plrtco an indefinite timo after 
the d,wlb of Pytlmgora~; and the 
latter, instead of tho burning, re• 
latos another incident in the time 
uf Cylun. Even Aristotlij (ap. 
Diog. ii. 446, cf. viii. 4\J) inei­
dente1.lly mentions Dylan's enmity 
ugainst Pythagoras, which had be­
come provorliial. Thc~e earlier 
conflicts, however, cannot have oc­
casiou€d the overthrow of the Py­
thagoree1ns in Lower Italy. This 
can <.>nly 11.a 1•e happened ( ewm AO· 
col'(liug to Polybius) when the 
burning of the couneil hou8e in 
Orotona gave tile sigual for simi)l).1" 
acts in other places, and a unive:csal 
strn·m Liroke out agai1u;t the Py­
thagoreans. When, therefore, 
Aristoxonus says that the Pytlrngo­
reans kept tbe lead of public affair~ 
in the cjties of Tufagn;; G=ia fa~ 
some, tirn~ after the first attack 
npon them, there is ew:ry reil.Son fur 
cr~diting the stat~me11t. Fo1.1rthly. 
If the first popul:tr movement 
agaiw;t the J:'ythagoreans was con­
fined to Crotmm, a,m) ifthry finally 
m,iintained themselres there, it is 
nr:,t probable that Psthagoras, con·

gained entrance there,1 and certain individuals bad 
turned their attention to the philosophic doctrines of 
the school.2 At this period, at all events, we first hear 
of Pythagorean writings J and of Pythagoreans who lived 
elsewhere than in Italy. The first of these with whom 
we are acquainted, is Philolaus,4 "\Ve know that lie 
was a contemporary of Socrates and Democritus, and 
probably was older than either ; that in the last decade 
of the fifth century he resided in Thebes," and that he

was the author of the first e.x:position of the Pythagorean 
~ystem.1 Lysis must also have come to Thebes about 
the same time as Philolaus, and probably resided there 
up to the second decade of the fourth century,2 Plato 3 
assigns Timmus the Locrian to the same period, but it 
is not certain whether or not this Timr:eus was a his­
torical personage. Among the disciples of Philolaus 
is mentioned Eurytus,4 of Tarentum or Crotona, who 
must also be supposed to have spent a part of his life 
out of Italy, siuce those of his pupils who are known 
to us came, one of them from Thrace, the others from 
Phlius.5 These scholars of Eurytus are called by Aris-
(fambl. V. P. 104), with othol's of 
a. similar kind, a.re refuted. Ac• 
cording to Diog. ,-iii." 84, Philulaus 
was put to dMth in Croton~ on 
suspicion ofniming at the Tyranny. 
Ha must, therefore, ha1'"e r~tuu1ecl 
to Italy, and become impliC1J.ted in 
the final party conflicts witl1 tha 
Pytlrng01·ean8.

with them the school, as such, became extinc,t.1 The

though tbe Bacchic Pythagorean rites may have con­

nished a pretext to Diodorus of Aspendus,3 for deaig­
nating his cynicism as Pythagorean Philosophy. 
Even in Italy, however, the Pythagorean school was

teachers would seem to have maintained their positiou 
even before the restoration of peace. At all events, if 
the sojourn of Philolaus in Heraclca,1 for instance, be a 
hifJtorical fact, it perhaps may have occurred previously 
to tha.t . epoch. In this same town is said to have 
lived Cliuias the Tarentine,2 who in any case was no 
doubt a nmu contemporary of Philolaus.3 As to his 
philosophical importance, wo can decide nothing. J\:f any 
proofa have come down to us of the purity, gentleness, 
and nobility of his character ; 4 but we pos8ess very fow

tioned as another of his contemporaries in Oyrene,6 to 
which city, if this statement bfi true, Pythagorea.nism

of Archytas/ to new political importance. We know

theories ; nor can we determine how far a philosophic 
impulse was connected with this renewed life of the 
school. Soon after the period of Archytas the Pytlm­
gorean school, even in Italy, seems to have died out, or 
at any rate, to have been represented only by some 
isolated followers. .Aristoxenus, at least, speaks of it as 
an entirely extinct phenomcnon,1 and we have no in­
formation from other sources as to the longer continu­

368 TRE PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY, 
many others are named in the confused and ill-arranged 
catalogue of famblichus,1 and elsewhere. But several 
of these names evidently do not belong to the Pytha­
goreans at all; others have possibly been introduced by 
subseguent interpolators; and all are worthless for us, 
because we know nothing further about the men they 
designate. There are, however, some few men who are 
connected with the Pythagorean school, but do not 
properly belong to it, whom we shall have to notice 
later on. 
III. TIIE PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY; ITS FUNDA· 
ME}iTAL CONOEP110NS ,- JW,}IBER AND THE 1'.'LE­
MENTS OP 1,'UMBER. 
IN order to estimate rightly the philosophy of the 
Pythagoreans, it is of the highest importance that we 
should distinguish in their doctrines and institutions 
that which is pliilosophical in the narrower sense from 
that which has arisen from other sources and motives. 
The Pytbagoreans eonstitute primarily not a scientific, 
but a moral, :religious, and political association; ~ and 
though a definite tendency of philosophic thought was 
developed in thfa as~ociation a.t an early period, and 
. probably by its very founder, yet its members were not 
all philosophers, nor were all the doctrines and opinions 
' Vit. Pyta. 267 gqq. 
' Vide supra, 3(i2 sq. The uamc 
' Pythngoreans' or 'Pythagorici' 
su,ms to have l,t,en origio"'llJ', like 
Cylonists or Orphici, a party de­

rather than a philosophiell.l kind, 
!Mlstowed on them, perhaps, by 
their eIJemies. This seems to ex·

NUMBER, 
which they entertained the result of philosopbit: enquiry. 
On the contrary, many of the~e may have arisen iude­
pendent1y of such enquiry, and may have related to 
ohjects with which the Pythagorean philornphy never 
concerned itsdf. Although, therefore, ju cornidei'ing 
these doctrines and opi11ions, we ought not to lose 
sight of their possible connection with the purely 
philosophic doctrines, yet we must not reekon all that 
is Pythagorean as belm1ging to the Pythagm-ean Philo­
Mphy. As well might we regard all that is Hellenic 
as Greel: plrilosophy, or all tha.t is to be four.cl among 
ChristiLn peoples as Christian philosophy. Wt; have 
conHcqucntly to enqnire in each particular case how 
far any Pythagorean doctrine is philosophic as to its 
content, that is, how far it may or may not be' ex~ 
plained by the philosophic charnct.rr of the school. 
The most generally distinctive doctrine of the 
Pythagorean philosophy is contained in the proposition 
that number ts the eEsence of all things, that every­
thing, in its cs~ence, is nuwber. 1 lio,v we are to uuder-

stand t,his formula, however, :is a point on which out 
authorities are in appearance not fully agreed. On the 
one side, Aristotle frequently asserts that, according to 
the Pythagoreau theory, thing~ consist of numbcrs,1 or 
of the elements of numbers; 2 that numbers are not 
merely qualities of a third ,mb~tance, bnt immediately, 
and in themselves, the substance of things; and form 
the eS8ence of things ; yet for that very reason, do not, 
exist apart from things, like the Platonic ideas. 3 He, 
therefore, in considering the relation of the Pytha­
gorean numbers to his four kinds of causes, places 
them among the material, as well as the formal causes;

betwtien numbers and the things numbered, aud es­
pecially between Unity and the One.1 From this it 
has been inferred that they developed their doctrine of 
numbci-s in different directions; one division of tlrn 
school holding nmX1bers to he the inherent ground of' 
things, and another seeing in them merely prototypes.2 
Axistot.le, however, gives no countenance to such a 
theory. In his work on the heavens, indeed, he is only 
speaking of a JJOrtion of the Pytbagoreans wht>n he 
says they made tbe world to eonsist of numbers; but 
it docs not follow that the rest of the school explained 
l:bc world in a different way. He may very po~sibly 
have expre~sod himself in this manner, bet:ause aH 
theories of numbers were not developed into a cou­
struction of the univorsc,3 or hec,mse the name of 
Pythagorean~ denoted other~ besides the Pythagore;1n

vi,1., that things consist of numbr-,rs, aIJd that they arc 
copied from numbers-to the Pythagoreans generally; 
and the two statemeub appear not in widely scparn.ted 
passages, but in such close juxtaposition, that if they 
had been in his opinion irreconcilable, their contradic­
toriness could not po~sibly have escaped him. Beccmse 
the Pythagoreans discovered many similarities between 
numbers and things, he ~ays (Jlfetnph .. i. 5; xiv. ~) 
they held the elements of numbers to be the elements 
of things; they perceived in number (he adds in the 
same chapter) toth the matter and the qualities of 
things; and in the same place that he a~cribes to them 
the doctrine of the imitation of tbing3 by number;;, 
1lfotaph. i. 6, he assert~ tbat they differed from Plato 
in considering number1s, not as Plato did the ideas as 
separate from thing~, but as the things themselves. 
From this it is evident that tl1e two statements 'num­
liers are the subst:i.nce of things,' and 'numbers are the 
prntotypes of things/ do not, in Aristotle's opinion, ex­
clude one another; 2 the Pythagoreans, according to his

wprescntation, considered thi1:tgs to be the copies of 
numbers, for the very reason that numbers are tl,e 
essence of which things consist, and the properties of 
which must therefore be cognisablo in them. Philolaus 
places number in this same xelation to things when he 
describes it (lac. cit.) as their law and the cause of 
their properties and relations; for there is the same 
relation between la,v and its fulfilment as between pro­
totype and copy. Later writers, indroed, conceive the 
Pythagorean numbers entirely after the manner of the 
Platonic ideas-as models external to things. There 
are traces, however, even among ·those writers of the 
contrary opinion. 1 But we cannot attach much im­
portance to the testimony of persons who are evidently 
unable to distinguish earlier theories from later, or the 
Pythagorean doctrines from those of the l'latonists and 
N eo-Pythagoreans. 2 
'l'be meaning of the Pythagorean fundamental doc­
trine then is this :~All is number, i.e., all consists of 
numbers ; number is not merely the form by which 
the constitution of things is determined, but also the

substance aml the matter of which they consist. It is 
one of the essential peculiarities of the Pythagorean 
standpoint thv.t the distinction of form and matter is 
not as yet rncognised. We regard numbers only as an 
e.x:prcssion for the relation of substances, they directly 
seek in them the essence and substance of the real. 
The Pytbagorcans (a,; we are told by Aristotle,1 and 
also by Philolaus~) were doubtless led to this theory by 
pcrce1viug that all phenomena are ordered accordi11g to 
numbers; that especially the relations of the heavenly 
bodies, and of tones, and, generally speaking, all 
mathematical conceptions, are governed by certa:n 
numbers and numerical proporliolli'. Thi~ observation 
is itself connected with the ancient use of symbolic 
round numbers, and with the belief in the occult power 
and significance of particular nnmbers,3 which belief 
was current among the Greeks as among otlrnr nations, 
and probably existed from tlie very commencement in 
the _pythagorean mysteries. But as' Plato subsequently 
gave substance to the Idea-a,; tbe Eleatics made the 
real, which was at first conceived as a predicate of all 
things, the s<Jle and univers~l substance--so by virtue 
of the same realism, which was so natural to antiquity, 
the Pythagoroans regarded mathematical, or more ac­
curntely, aritbmetkal determinations, not as a form or

TIIE l'YTHA GOREANS. 
Pythagoreans conclllded that the odd and the even are 
the universal coustituents of nwnbern, and furthermore, 
of things. They identified the uneven with the 
limited, and the even with the unlimited, because 
the uneven sets a limit to bi-partition, and the even 
does not.1 Thus they arrived at the proposition that 
class; tbQse which result from enll 
antl uneven fucton, t.o the se~ond ; 
those which result from even fac, 
tors only, t<'> the thitd.

:380 THE PYTHAGOREANS. 
this proposition is connected t.he following observation: 
that everything unites in itself opposite charncteri~tics. 
Those characteristics they tried to reduce to the funda­
mental oppusitiou of the limited and the unlimited, 
odd and even. The limited and the uneven was held, 
howfwer, by the Pythagoreans, in agreement with t11e 
popular belief, as the better and more perfect, the un­
limited and the even as the imperfect,,l Wherever, 
therefore, they perceived opposite qualities, they re­
garded the better as limited 0r uneven, and the worse 
as 1rnlimited and even. Thus, according to them, all 
things were divided into two categories, of which one. 
was on the side of the limited, and the other on that 
of the unlimitc(l.2 The number of these categories was 
thPn more precisely fixed by the sacred number icn, 
and 1J[]limit.e<l; and as the~~ de­

382 THE PYTIIAGOREAKS. 
it was universaHy admitted both by earlier and later 
Pythagoreaus that things are compounded out of 
opposing elements; and ultimately, out of the odd and 
the even, or the limited and the unlimited; and there­
fore they must all have reduced the given phenomena 
to these and similir oppo.,ites.1 The drawing up of a 
tlo ( virlo infra § vii.) Alcm;,:;on had 
ali~eady a,lmitt.ecl the ten opposi­
tiuos, . t.r, qur. n,;,u,\ t•enons de les 
tJ..7•os8r.' But Arl::-i-totle asserts'.! a.s 
is qnite obvious, not that Alcmili!on 
admitted thB ten opposites, but 
that, in n.greement with the Pytha­
gon11ns. he asR11mcd human life t" 
be rnled by oppositions; which, 
howe,,er, he ,lid not like them ra­
dnte to fixed and definite ca.te­
go1·ie.s. Aristotle, in short,, a.sserts 
pr~tty nearly the contrary of 1•,hat 
Cliaignet finds in him. 
' Vide imp. p. 378 sq. Brandis 
thinks he discovCTH in this a tracB 
of a different m;>.nner of conceiving 
the Pythagorean philosophy( Rhein. 
J',[u,1. ii. 214, 239 ~qq.; G,-, vmn. 
I'kil. i. 44.:i, 502 sqq. ). All, how­
ever, that c«n lie inforl'cr1 from the 
words of A,•istotlo is this: that all 
the Pvtlrn.gorcans did not hold the 
de~uple table of oppositions, but 
some of tb em held only the fa uda­
mental opposition of th€ Odd or 
the Limited, and the }';yen Rnd the 
Unlimited. Thifi does not e;i:dude 
the possibility t!rn.t these latter 
I'ythagoreans may have fl.pplied 
th11t funua.mental opposition tn tl,c 
explanation of phenomena, a11d 
may have reduced to it lhe oppo­
sites which they ohserved in things. 
Such altcmpts, indeed, were so 
dfreetly necessitated by the gene­
ral theory of the 8~hool that things 
are a combination of the Limited 
and the i.;-nlimitcd, the Odd and 
t.lrn E~en, tl1at we can hi!:rdly con­
ceive, of the one without the other. 
How could thi" doetrine of the

TA.BLE OF OPPOSITES. 
table of mch opposites was nothing more than a formal 
development ; for the comprehension of the fundamental 
doctrines of Pythagoreanism this table is of the less 
importance, since in it the separate numbers are not 
the result of ri.ny deduction according to a definite 
principle, but out of all the opposites tL.at are given to 
us empirically, certain of the most prominent,1 chosen 
in a somewhat arbitrary manner, are enumerated, until 
the number ten is complete. So aL:o the apportion­
ment of the particular concepts to the several series is 
to a great extent arbitrary, although generally speaking 
we cannot mistake the leading point of view, which 
consists in au at.tempt to assign the uniform, the perfect, 
the ~elf-completed~ to the Limited; and the opposite 
categorie~ of these, to the L nlimitcd. 
According to thfa theory thA primuy constituents 
of things are of a di~similar and opposite nature; a

harmony,1 which is defined by 'Philolaus as the unity of 
the manifold, and the uccord of the discordant. 2 As

all things, so must harmony he present ]ikcwfoe; and it 
may with equal pr0pricty be said that all i; mun her

union, or a harmony of the orld :md the even. But, as 
with the Pythagoreans, the perception of the inherent 
contra.dictions in things primarily connects itself w"ith 
the idea of number, so the recognition of the harmony 
which reconciles these contradictions is connected with 
the idea of musieal relations; harmony as conceived by

anJ transfor to it the relations of musical harmony, 
which they were the fin,t to determine.1 
Before we go further, however, it seems neccRsary 
t.o examine some different opinions concerning tlie 
Pyi.hagore·an doctrine of first principles ; opiniom 
founded partly on the statements of ancient authors, 
and partly on the conjectures of modern scholars. Ac­
cording to our exposition so far, the Pythagorean system 
started from the proposition tbat all is, in its essence, 
number. From this results the doctrine of the primi­
tive opposites; and consequently, the opposition of the 
crooked and the straight, the limited and the unlimited 
precede all others. 'l'he unity likewise of lhese oppo­
sites wa., sought in number alone, which wa8 therefore 
defined more particularly as harmony. !i-fany of onr 
authorities, however, represent the matter differently. 
They assert that the entire system was founded on the 
0pposition of unity and duality, which is then reduced 
to the opposition of spiritual a.nd corporeal, of form and 
subHtance, of the Deity and matter, and is itself derived 
from the Deity as the original Unity. According to 
another theory, the starting point of the system was not 
the arithmetical conception of number and its constita­
cnt.s, but the geometrical conception of the limits of 
space and of unlimited space. A third opinion bases 
the system not on the consideration of number, but on 
the distinction of the limited and unHmited. We have 
now to enquire how much in aU this is in accordance 
with historical evidence and internal probability. 
The first of the above-mentioned theories is found

UNITY AND _DUALITY. .':!87 
soon after the commencement of the fir8t ceutury be­
fore Christ in Alexander Polyhistor. The Pythagoreans, 
he tells us, appealiog to statements of the l'ythagoreans, 
regarded Unity as the beginning of all things; from 
Unity arose indefinite Duality, which was related to 
Unity as rnfttter to the efficient cause ; from l;nity and 
Duality sprang numbers,and from numbers, points,&c.1 
This view is developed in the exteusive ex:cerpts in 
Sextus 2 from a Pythagorean work. According to it, 
the Pytbagoreans,. in a full discussion of the subject, 
maintained that the causes of sensible phenomena can 
lie neither in ,vhat is sensibly perceptible, nor in any­
thing corporeal, nor even in mathematical figures, but 
only in Unity and indeterminate Duality, and that all 
logical categories are in the end reducible to the;;e 
two principle$, They, therefore, regarded l~nity as 
efficient canse, and Duality a8 pasRive matter, and sup­
posed not merely numbers, but also figures, bodles, 
elements, and the world itself, to originate from the 
co-operation of the two principles.3 These principles

388 THE l'YTHAGORE.A.YS. 
receive a further interpretation from the Keo-Pytha­
goreans and Neo-Platonists. The Pythagorean.s, says 
Rudorns, 1 reduced all t11ings ultimately t.o the One, by 
which they understood nothing else than the highest 
Deity; they derived from this two principles, the One 
and indefinite Duality, God and matter; under the 
former tbey clas~ed everything that i,, good, under the 
latter everything evil. Consequently they used variou~ 
names to desih>11ate these principles. The One they 
ca11fld the unc\"en, the masculine, the ordered. That 
which i8 opposed to unity they called the even, the 
feminine, the unordered, &c. Inasmuch, ho.vever, as 
this second element is derived from the One, tbe One 
alone is to be regarded as first principle in the trne 
sense of tbe word. Similarly, :i.\loderatus2 as~erts that

UNITY AlW DUALITY. 388 
the Pythagoreans briefly designated by the One the rela­
tion of unity, identity and equality, the ground of all 
concord and of all fixed consistency; and by d1rn1ity,1 
the prineoiple of all rnultiplicity, inequality, division, 
and chang-c. .T n agreement with this, we reau in t.he 
Plutarchic Placitn2 that of the two principles of Pytha­
goras, Unity denoted the good, reason, or deity; and 
indefinite DualiLy, evil, matter, and the dam10ns. Of 
these two writers, the fonner only is at the pains to 
tell us that the doctrines be ascribes to the Pylhago­
ri:ans \Vere nol stated by them in so many words, but arc 
merely hinted at in their number-theory. Other writer;,

3DO THE PYTHAGOREAlfS. 
The pseudo-Archytas I differs on1y from this interpre­
tation in making the distinction more prominent 
between the primitive essence and the two derived 
principle:i, and in apprehending thEi latter not in the 
Pythagorean, but in the Aristotelian form. He indi­
cates as the m0st universal principles; fonn and matter; 
form corresponds to the regulated and determinate, 
and matter to tbe unregulated and indeterminate ; 
form is a beneficent, and matter a destructive nature; 
but he discriminates both from the Deity, which, stand­
ing above them, moves matter towards form, and 
moulds it artistically. Lastly, numbers and geometrical 
figures ·are here represented, after the manner of Plato ; 
as the intermediate link between fonu and matter. It

But althougl1 these statements have found much 
favour with modern writers, they are not sufficiently 
attested to warrant our adoptiug eyen their essential 
substance. It bas already been observed that we can 
trust the information of later writers about the Pytha­
gorean p11ilosophy, and especially of Nco-Pythagorcau 
and Neo-Platonic writers, only to the extent that their 
sources are known to u~. But these sources are in tl1e 
present iu~t.aucc either not mentioned, or else they are 
contained in writings the authenticity of whicli is more 
than doubtful. In regard to the long fragment of 
Archytas, thfa has already been ~hown; there can 
~carccly be any question of it in the ca3e of the quow

artificfal character of the citation in Athenagoras is 
a sufficient reason for misLrustir1g it; even in the short 
saying of Archcenetus (or Archytas) the langwi.ge and 
standpoint of a later pF:riod are clearly discernible; 1 
and lastly, in a paHsage sairl to Le from AristotlF:, a 
definition of matter is attributed to Pytliagoras him­
self, which, in accl)rdance with the doctrine of the 
older academy, presupposes the distinction beLween 
form and mattei-,2 evidently showing eitJier that the 
writing is itself a forgery, or lhat it contains a false 
statement. The expoBition;;, too, which Sextu~ and

UNITY AND DUALITY. 
telian passages which mi;.i;ht seem to ascribe them to 
the Pytluigoreans, and which were constantly explained 
in this sense by the ancient commentators, relate entirely 
to Plato and the Academy. 1 Neither in Alexander's 
excerpts from Aristotle's work on the Good,2 in which 
the Platonic doctrine of Unity and indefinite Duality 
is developed at length, nor in what Porphyry 3 says on 
the same subject, are the Pythagoreans mentioned ; 4 
and though Theophrastus once alludes to indefinite 
Duality, after previously Darning the Pythagorcans to­
gether with Plato, the brevity with which he sums up 
the doctrines of both pre,;ents our drawing any in­
ference from this allusion. Moreover, according to the 
statements of Alexander and Porphyry, Plato places 
this doctrine in close conuection with the theo1·y of the 
Great and Smnll, which Aristotle declaJ·es categori-

utterly to be discarded. For t,his radical distinction 
of the corporeal and spiritual, of matt.er and efficient 
forc:e, is qnite at variance with the theory which l:hicf:Iy 
determines the character of Pythagoreanism, Vtz. that 
nnmlJcrs are t11e essence of which things consist. If 
once a discrimination were admitted between maHer 
and the formal principle, numbers would become, like 
the Platonic ideas, mere forms, anrl could no longer be 
considered as the suh,tantial elemeut:3 of the coJporoal. 
Such a distinction, however, is only ;,scribed to t.hr; 
Pytlrngoreans by writers to whose evidence, as we liavc 
seen, very limited credence can be given. Aristotle on 
t,he contrary emphatically declares 1 that Anaxagorns 
was tho first philosopher who rliscrimin.atcd spirit frnm 
matter, and he on this accouut includes the Pytha­
gorcans among those who recognised only ~cn~ible 
existence.2 Bul most of the staternenls tbat have come 
down to us ,especting the Pythagorean dochino of the 
divinity arc immediately connected with the theory 
of Unity and Duality, of spirit and matter. The 
divinity seems to have been conc:eivetl partly as t11(; 
first term of this oppositi0n, and partly as the higher 
unity which precedes t}1e opposition, engenders the two 
oppoRing elemcnt.s as sncb, and br.ing,; about their 
union. It~ therefore, this discrimimttion was first 
added to Pytbagoreanism by the later adherenb;: of tlrn

Ride by side with the Pythagorean philosophy, but how 
far it had any logical connection with the philosophic 
doctrines of the school; wht:ther, i:u short, the idea of 
God was deduced by the Pythagoreans from their 
philosophic theory of the universe, or was used by them 
to explain it.1 General i1s this latter assumptfon may he, 
it appears to me unfoun :led. The Deity, it is thought 
hy some, was distinguished by the Pythagorean~ as 
absolute unity, from unity concei1,ed as in opposition, 
or from the limit; consequently, it was also dis­
tinguished from the world, anrl exalted above the whole 
sphere of opposites.2 Others say 3 that the first one,

The opinio1Js which a philosopher

to be considered part of his philo­

express distinction 1 between the Pythagoreans and 
those who represent the Deity as efficient cause.2 
Philolaus indeed calls the one the beginning of all 
things,3 but he can scarcely mean anything more hy 
this than what Aristotle ~ays : viz., that the number 
one is the root of all numbers, and therefore, since all 
thingH consist of nnmbers, it is also the principle of 
all thing-s.4 He further describes God as the sole 
the 'Evan and tlrn Odd,' only 1'€­
sults from the One, the One t,1nnot 
have TCsu ltod from these : the 
word, ,i~ &[l.</)oTipwv -ro~,rwv do not 
il1ercfo1·e signify de~ivcd from both, 
but eorMi.st;ng of both. This ob­
,icction is based 11pon a manifest 
confusion: the E-ven and Odd 
irnmb1,r is net the Eiicn and /he 
Odd; the expression, 'that is to 
say,' is consequently not legiti­
mate, and the ouly sense which the 
words of Aristotle can have, a,,;­
cordirrn; to the context, is the fol­
lowin£: lirst, the One a.rises out 
of the Odd and the Even, and 
then the other numbers pr\lCeecl

GOD AND MATTER. 403 
expresses in a religious form a thought which was then 
no longer confined to the schools of philosophy, and 
which sounds more like the language of Xenophancs 
than anything peculiarly Pythagorean. The second 
propo.sition taken from the 01·phico-Pythagorea.n mys­
teries I is entirely of a religious and popular nature.2 
Neither one nor the other is employed as the basis of 
philosophic definitions. If, lastly, Philolam as~erted 
that the Deity brought forth limit and unlimitedness,3 
this certainly presupposes that all is to be referrerl to 
the Divine causality; hut as no account is giYen how 
God brought forth the first causes, and how he is t8later1 
to them, this theorem mernly bears the character of a 
religiom presupposition. Frow a philosophic point of 
view it merely shows that Philolaus knew not how to 
explain the origin of the opposition of the Limited and 
Unlimited. He rnems to think that, they, as he rnys in 
another place of harmony, 4 arose in some way wLich it 
is impos2:ible accurately to define. Even in the time of 
Neo-Pythagoreanism the prevailing distinction of the 
supra-mundane One from the .. Monad was not universally 
acknowledged." \Ye cannot but admit, therefore, that 
' Thi~ ekarly appears from 
Plato, loc. cit.

' According to Syrian, vide su-

404 THE PY1'HAUOREANS. 
the Pythagoreans believed in gods. It is also probable 
that they followed the monotheistic tendency ( which 
after the time of Xenophaues exercised snch an im­
portant influence on Greek philosophy) so far as amidst 
the plurality of gods to pl'Oclaim, with greater emphasis 
than the popular religion, the unity (& Beos, 'TO 8/iov); 1 
at the same time, however, the import of the idea of 
God in relation to their philo8ophio system seems to 
have been small,2 nor does it appear to have been closely 
interwoven with their enquiry concerning the first prin­
ciples of things.3 
I am consequently the less able to believe that the 
Pythagoreans tanght a development of God in the 
universe, by which He gradually arrived at perfection 
through irnperfodion.4 This theory is closely connected 
1 Jlut certainly in connection 
with the popufar belief; so that 
for them, as for the generality of 
people, the 9{;ov is identical with 
Zeus. Cf. their tlworim, as to the 
oversight exerdscd. by Ztu~ aud all 
connected -v.i th it. 
• Tiockh, Phil. 148, observes 
that witliout the thBO_ry of a 
higher "C"nity, above the Limited 
and Unlimited, there would ra~ 
main no trace in the system of 
the Pythagcrcans, renowned as 
they '\!'ere for their religious idea,, 
of the Divinity. Thisrenmrk does 
not [Jl·~judke my opinion in the 
hist. I do not deny tlu,t they 
1·educcd cYcrything ta the Di'l"inity, 
but I contend that in so duing. 
they did uot proce~d in a scientific 
manner; and this seem~ to me t.ha 
easier to understand, bccau~c by 
virtue of tlrnir religions charact.er, 
this dependaDee of all thiugs in 
rrspeet to the Di,ioity was for 
tham an immediate postulate, ancl 
Dot a scientific. p~oblcm. Roth (ii. 
a, 769 sqq.) himself, repugnant as 
this ,cssert1cm naturally is to him, 
is obliged to confess tk,t the 
sacredness and inviolability of 
Pythagoras' cb•clc of idoilS, in re~ 
gaxd ta religious speculat'on, left 
little morn for the frM in telle~tual 
do..-elopmcnt of his school ; and

according lo Roth) left to us by 
the Pytlmgorean~, t!1Pre is nom, 
whiili has properly a ~peculatiYe 
character; but that they aro all

with the statement that they held the One to be the 
Deity. FM the One is described as the Even-Odd, and 
as the Odd is the perfect, and the Even the imperfect, 
so, it is argned, they supposed not only the perfect but 
the imperfect, and the reason of iw.perfection, to be in 
God, and accordingly held that the perfect good can 
only arise from a development of God. I must protest 
against such an inference, if only upon the ground that 
I dispute the identity of the One with the Deity. But 
even irrespectively of this, it could not be true, for 
though the number one was called by the Pythagoreans 
the even-odd, the One which is opposed as one of the 
primitive causes to indefinite Duality is never so called,1 
and never could he ; and the number one, as that which 
is derived from the primitive causes, and compounded 
of them, could in no case be identified with the Deity.2 
Aristotle certainly says that the Pythagoreans, like 
Speusippus, denied tb.at the fairest and best could have 
existed from the beg-inniug; 3 and as he mentions this 
theory in connection with his own doctrine of the eter-

thagoreans. For it doQs not follow,

therefore, Limselfimperfect. Otlm··

especially with Plaw, to whom 
this ass~rtion originally belongs.

nity of God, it has the appearance of having abo been 
applied hy the Pythagoreans to the notion of Deity. 
Iu the first place, however, it docs not at all necessarily 
follow from this that the Divinity was at first imperfect, 
and afterwards attained to perfoction. As Speusippus 
concluded from this propo,::ition that the One as the first 
principb must be distinct from the good and from the 
Deity,1 so the Pythagorcans may in like manner have 
separuted them.~ But it is also a question whether the 
theorem which Aristotle disputes \Vas ever advanced by 
the Pyt;hagoreans with respect to the Deity; for Aristotle 
docs not always quote the definitions of the earlier 
philosophers quite in the connection in which their 
authors originally stated them, as may be proved by 
numerous examples.3 \Ve do not know whatserne may 
have been given t<1 this proposition in the Pythago­
rean system. It may have referred to the development 
of the world from a previous sb1te of imperfection, or 
to the production of the perfect number ( the decad) 
from the le5s perfect ; 1 or to the position of the good 
in the tuble of opposites, & or to some other object.. \Ve

DEVELOPMENT OF GOD. 407 
are not therefore ju~tified by this Aristotelian passage, 
in ascribing to the Pythagoreans a doctrine which not 
only co:D.tradict~ Philolaus' :representation of the Deity, 
but is quite unknown to antiquity; 1 though, if it had 
really existed among the Pytliagoreans, it might on 
that very account be expected to recei·,e all the more 
definite mention from the ancient writers. 
Having in the foregoing pages opposed the theolo­
gico-metaphysical interpretation of the Pythagorean 
first principlcH, I rnwit now declare myself no Jes:;, 
strongly against the theory that these principles pri­
marily refer to space-relations, and side by side with 
the arithmetical element, or instead of it, denote 
something geurnetrical, 01· eveu altogether material. · 
Aristotle says the Pythagoreans treated numbers as 
space-magnitudes; 2 he often mentions the theory that 
geometrical figures are the substantial element of 
which bodies comist,3 and his commentators go further, 
1 The ancient philosophers, it 
is true, freq ,wntl y m>1intaiu lhat 
t!w world was developed from a 
rudimentary and formless ~tatn, 
hut never that the JJivinilJ/ was 
developecl, The ductrine uf Hera­

such teRclling, For the succcssi,·o 
for:ws of the DiYine essence are 
89mething rntirely differenL from 
" development of that es~ence ont 
of an imperfo~L slate. The primi­
tirn li~a which, as the germ of the 
WOl'lcL i~ e.nv::ee<lent tD the wurld, 
is here regardod as the most per­
fect e"isknce, the u6pos, Lastly 
if tho Theogonies represent parii'.

to the Pythagoreans. Philolaus attempts to derive' 
sometimes the corporeal in general, and sometimes the 
physical fundamental qualities of bodie3 from figures, 
and figures from numbers. From this Ritter concludes,1 
and Hermann 2 and Steinhart 3 agree with him, that 
the Limiting principle of the Pytbagoreans was the 
unit, or, viewed in regard to ~pace, the point ; and the 
Unlimited, the interspace or tbe void; when, therefore, 
they said that all things consist of the Limit and the 
Unlimited, they me~nt that all thing·s are compo~ed of 
points and empty interspaces, and when they asserted 
that all things an" number, this ,vas only to express that 
these points together form a number. Rejnhold 1 and 
Brandis ·0 contest this, not because they maintain more 
strongly the arithmetical nature of the Pythagorean 
numbers, but because they would have them regarded 
as material; for in their judgment, the Pytbagorcans 
understood by the Gnlimited, the material cause of tbe 
corporeal,6 and accordingly nurnbcrn, of which all things 
consist, must have been conceived by them as some­
thing corporeal : number, Reinhold considers, arises 
from the determination of the indeterminate matter by 
Unity or Limit, and things are called numbers berause 
all things consist of a manifold element determined by 
Unity. Against this, Ritter rightly urges 1 that we ought 
to distinguish between the Pythagorean doctrines them-

selves and Aristotle's conclmions from them. The ma­
terhLlity of the Pythagorean numbers was first deduced 
by Aristotle from the doctrine that all is number ; 1 the 
l'ythagoreans ean never have explained numbers and 
their elements as something corporeal ; for Aristotle ex­
pr0essly says that they did not intend, by their concept 
of the Limited, the Uolimited and the One, to describe 
a snbstratum of which tbe~e concepts were predicated ; 2 
and this would unquestionably have beeo the case if 
the Unlimited had been, in their opinion, merely un­
limited matter. He observes that the number of 
which all things ?OUsist must, according to their theory, 
have been mathematical number, and he charges them 
on this account with the contradiction of making bodies 
arise from the incorporeal, and the material from the 
immateifal.3 This conclusion, however, can only be 
valid from an Aristotelian or some other later standpoint. 
To anyone accustomed to discriminate between corporeal 
and incorporeal, it mu~t seem evident thttt bodies can

only be compounded out of bodies, and so it. inevitably 
follows that numbers and their elements must be som.e}­
thing corporeal if bodies are to consist of them. The 
special characteristic of the Pythag·orean Philosophy 
however lies in this, that such a distinction is as yet 
unrecognisc<l, and that, in consequence, number as such 
is regarded not only as the form, but as the matter of 
the cOJ·poreal. Yet number it~elf is not on that account 
necesearily conceived as corporeal ; for it is clear that 
qualities and relations which no one except the Stoics, 
or before their tiwe, ever considered as bodies, were 
expressed in the Pythagorean Philosophy by numbers. 
The Pythagoreans not only defined man, or plants, or 
the earth by numbers, but, aaserted that two fa opinion, 
four justice, five marriage, seven the oppol'tnne time, 
etc.1 Nor is this simple comparison. The meaning in 
both case;; is that the specified number .is propedy anrl 
directly the thing with which it is compared. It is a 
confounding of symbol and concept, a mixture of 
the accidental and the· mhstantial, which we cannot 
dist:ard without mistaking the e.~sential peculiarity of 
Pythagorean thought. As ,ve cannot assP-rt that bodies 
were regarded as immaterial by the Pythagoreans, be­
cause, according to them, bodies consisted of numbers, 
so neither, on the other hall'l, can we infer that num­
bers must have been something corporeal, because they 
conld,not otherwise have been the clement.~ of bodie3.

,vere directly identified, while the inadmissibility of 
such a procednre was unnoticed. For simila.r reasons, 
it is of no avail to prove that the One, the Unlimited 
and the Void receive a material signification in the 
Pythagorean physics. "i-Ve read, it, is true, that in the 
forming of the world, the nearest part of the Un­
limited became attracted and limited by the first Onc,1 
and that outside the world was the Unlimited, from 
which the wcrld inhaled empty ~pace and time.2 In 
this connection the One certainly appear~ as material 
unity, aud the Unlimited to some ex.tent as unlimited 
space, to some extent also as an infinite mass ; but it 
by no means follows that the two conceptions have 
a1ways the ;;ame meaning apart from this order of ideas : 
on the contrary, we have bere an instance of what we 
so often find with the Pyfl1agoreans-that a general 
concoption receives a special dcter~ination from its 
application to a particular case, although this determi­
nation does not on that acconnt essentially belong to 
the conception, nor exclude other applications of it, in 
which it may be used in a different sense. It was only 
by the help of such a method that the Pythagoreans 
could apply the theory of numbers to concrete phe­
nomena. It i8 possible that in certain case8 the One, 
the Unlimited, "\"umber, &c., may have been regarded 
as corporeal. But we cannot conclude from this that 
they were wrviversally conceived as such, \Ye must 
remember that numerical determinations are very va­
riously employed by the Pythagoreans, a~d that the

NATURB OF TIIEIR PRINCIPLES. 413 
unlimited and the limited are of different kinds,1 which 
are not clearly dfatinguished because the language of 
Philosophy was as yet too nnformed, and thought too 
unpractised in logical dcducLion and the analysis of 
concepts. 
For similar reasons I must contest Ritter's theory. 
That tbe Pytbagoreans derived bodies from geometrical 
figures is true, and will be shown later on; it is also 
true that they reduced figures aud tipace-dimensions to 
numbers, the point to Unity, the line to Duality, and so 
on, and that they reckoned infinite space, intermediate 
space, and the voill under the head of the Unlimited.2 
But it does not follow from thi,; that by Unit.y they 
understood nothing but the point, by the Unlimited 
nothing but empty spa.cc; here again all that we have 
just Haid as to the application of their principles to 
phenomena holds good. 1'hey themsekes dc,ignate 
by the name of the Unity not. the point men,I_y, but 
the soul; by t,hat of Duality, not the line merely, but 
opinion; tlwy mfl.ke time as well as empty space enter 
the world from the Cnlimited. It is evident that 
the conceptions of the Limit, the Unlimited, Unity, 
Number, hav!'l a wider compass than those of the point, 
the void an<l figures ; figures, at any rat.e, are expressly 
distingui~he<l from the munbern by wbid1 they are 
' Ritter 8ays (i. H4) that the

strictly interpreted, must apply to the Limiting, and 
not to the Unlimited,2 Not much stresa, however, can 
be laid upon the last-mentioned circumstance, because 
the Pythagoreans seem to have here involved themselves 
in a contra(liction with their other theories. 
But the most decisive argument against the in­

ber formed its point of departure. Had it started 
from the consideration of unlimited matter, and of 
particles of matter, a system of mechanical physics, 
similar to the Atomistic system must bM·e beeu the 
result. Nothing of this kind is to be found :in pure 
Pythagoreanfam. The number-theory, on the other 
hand, the most essential i:rnd specific part of the system, 
could never in that case have arisen : the proportioM 
of bodies might perhaps have been defined accoJ'd­
ing to numbers, but there would have been no pos­
sible reason for regarrling numbers as the substance of 
things. This, the fundamental conception of the whole 
system, can only be accounted for, if the system be 
dominated by the idea of numerical relations, if its 
original tendency were to regard bodies as numbers, 
and not numbers as bodies. w·e are expressly told that 
Ecpbantm, a later philo~opher, wbo scarcely crm be 
numbered among the Pythagoreans at a11, was the first 
to explain the P_ythagorean ::.'llonads as sDmething 
corporeal.1 The ancient l'ythagoreans cannot have 
held such an opinion, for in tlmt case they must have 
believed the corporeal to have been something original, 
instead of <leriving· it, as we lrnve just shown that they

originally meant by the Unlimited infinite matter. The 
Unlimited must have acquired this import indirectly 
in its application to the cosmos ; otherwise it is in­
comprehensible how they came to explain the Unlimited 
as the Even. The ~ame considerations hold good as 
against the theory of Ritter. Since geometrical 
figures were derived from numbers, the elements of 
figure-that is to my the point and the interspace-­
must be posterior to the elements of number, and so 
they were unquestionably regarded by t.he Pythag-oreans. 
For the odd and the even cannot be derived from the 
point and tbe interspMe, whereas it is qnite cou­
ceivable from the Pythagorean point of view that the 
odd and the even should first have been discriminated 
as elements of number, that the more general antithesis 
of the Limiting and t.hc Unlimited should thence have 
been attained, and in the application cif this to space re­
lations, that the point should liave been regarded as the 
first limit of space, and empty space as the unlimited. 
Had the Pythagorean philosophy taken the opposite 
course, and proceeded from space dimensions and figures 
to numbers, t}ie geometrical element in it nmst have 
predominated over the arithmetical ; figure, instead of 
number, must have been declared to be the essence of 
things ; and the system of geometrical figureH mu.st 
have taken the place of the dccuple numerical system.

STARTLVG-POINT OF THE SYSTEM. 417 
since the· relations of tones were never reduced by them 
to space relations. 
Having thus shown the essentially arithmetical 
character of the Pythagorean principles, it only re­
mains to enquire how these principles were related to 
one another, and wherein lay the speeific point of 
departure of the system ; whether the Pytliagoreans 
,vere led from the proposition that all il:1' number to the 
tliEcrimination of the elements of which numbers and 
things consist, or conversely from the perception of the 
primitive opposites to the doctrine that the essence of 
things lieR in number. The Axposition of Aristotle 
tells in favour of the fost opinion ; for, according to 
him, the Pythagoreans first concluded from the simi­
larity of things to numbers, that al1 things were num­
bers, a.nd afterwards coupled with this proposition the 
distinction of the opposite elements of which numbers 
consist.1 Philolaus, on the contrary, began his work 
with the doctrine of the Limit and the Gnlimited,2 
which might incline us to presuppose that this, or an 
analogous definition, contained the proper root of the 
Pythagorean system, and that the Pythagoreans had 
only reduced all things to numlicr because they thought 
they perceived in number t,he first combination of the 
limited and the unlimited, of unity and mnltiplieity,3 
This, however, is not nceeP-sarily the case ; Philolaus, foe 
the sake of logical argument, may very likely haYe placed

that last which, historically, was the beginning of the 
~ystem. On the other hand, we must certainly consider 
the exposition of Aristotle as primarily his own view, 
not as direct evidence establishing a fact. Yet there is 
every probability that this vie,v is based upon an exact 
knowledge of the real interconnection of the Pytha­
gorean idt>as. It is, indeed, most likely that the start­
ing point of a system so ancient, and so independent of 
any earlier scientific developments, would have been 
formed by the simplest and most obvious presentation; 
that the thought which was less developed therefore, 
and more directly connected with relations sensibly 
perceived, the thought that all is number, would have 
been prior to the reduction of num1Jer to its ele­
ments ; and that the arithmetical distinction of the 
even and the odd would have preceded the more 
abstract logical distinction of the unlimited and tbe 
limited. If we maintain this latter distinction to have 
been the fundamental idea from which sprang the 
further development of t}ie system, it is hard to see 
why it should immediately have taken an arithmetical 
turn, instead of a more general and metaphysical 
direction. 'l'be proposition that all is number, and 
composed of the odd and the even, cannot possibly be 
derived from the theories concerning the limited and 
unlimited; but these might very easily and naturally 
have arisen i;,ut of that proposition.1 The exposition, 
therefore, of Aristotle, is fully justified. The funda­
mental conception from which the Pythagorean philo­
:-mphy starts, is contained in the proposition that all is

number; in the next p1ace, the opposite determinations 
in number-the odd and the even-were distinguished 
and compared, at first indeed very unmethodically, 
with other opposites, such as right and left, masculine 
and feminine, good and evil ; the more abstract ex­
pression of the limited and unlimited, although at a 
later time this opposition was placed by Philo1aus at 
the head of the ;,3stem, and so appears in the decuple 
table of categories, must belong to a more developed 
stage of reflection. Thus the principal ideas of this 
system are developed simply enough from one thought, 
and that thought is of a kind which might easily 
occur to the reflecting mind from the observation of 
the external wmld, even in the childhood of science.I

numbers and numerical relations; and the category of 
numbers which in this manner they obtained as an object, 
they regarded as the essence of that object. If, however, 
in any case reality did not entirely agree with the presup­
posed arithmetical scheme, they resorted to hypotheses 
like that ot the counter-earth to procure agreement. 
Thus they ~aid that justice consisted of tbe equal multi­
plied by the equal: or in the square numbe.r, because it re­
turns equal for equal; and they therefore identified jus­
tice I with four, as the first :-'quarc number, or nine, as the 
first unequal square number. So seven was the critical 
time, because in the opinion of the ancients, the 
climacteric year~ wBre determined by it; five, as the 
union of the first ma.sculins with the .first feminine 
number, was called marriage; one was reason, because 
i,t is unchangeabl~; two, opinion, because it is variable 
and imlcterminate.2 By furtlier combinations of such

«p16µ6P. As to the reasons for 
these assertions, traclilion tells us 
nothing. What P1·odus says on 
the subject is evidently based on his 
own conjectures, springing for the 
most part from the sphere of N eo­
PJaJoni~ ideas. It would seem the 
most probable solution to ;i.dmit 
that the angle must ha"l'e been coo­
scerate(l to Rhea, Demeter, and 
Hestia, as goddesses of the earth; 
because the square is the surfa.::e 
whir.h limits tho cube, and the cube, 
as we shall ace, was, aee.ording to 
Phifolaus, lhe primitive form of 
the catth. But this explanation 
does not agree with the names of 
the goddesses, Hera and Aphrodite, 
mentioned by Plut:trr.h, \Vas the

sical vagaries were permitted iu regard to this subject 
even in the ancient Pytbagm-ean ~chool, we can see from 
the example of .Eurytus, who attempted to prove the 
siguification of particular numbers by putting together 
the figures of the things they designated out of the 
corresponding number of pebbles.1 
The Pytbagoreans, however, did not content tbem­
~elves with this arbitrary application of their principles, 
but sought to carry them out methodically by more 
precisely defining the numerical proportions according 
to which all things are ordered, and applying them to 
the different classes of the Rea.I. "\Ye cannot indeed

could give us any clue on this subject, our knowledge 
is too scanty to allow of our determining with certainty 
the position which particular enquiries assumed in it. 
We shall, however, be adhering pretty closely to the 
natural connection of these enquiries if \Ve £rst con­
sider the number-system as such; next its application 
to tones ancl -figures ; thirdly, the dotltrine of the ele­
mentary bodies and notions about the univer~e; and 
finally, the tbeories on the terrestrial natures and man. 
It would be easy to reduce these divisions to more 
general points of view, but this I think ought not to be 
done, since we know nothing of ruiy division of the 
Pythagorean system of philosophy ,corresponding with 
the later discrimination of three principal parts, or any 
other classification of the kind. 
In order to reduce numbers themselves to a fixed 
schema, the Pythagoreans employed the division of 
odd and eyen, and also the system of decads. The 
former has been already alluded to (p. 377); in its 
further development ~arious species were discriminated 
from the even as well as from the odd ; whether these 
species were the ~ame as are enumerated by later 
writers• is not quite certain, nor can we be sure how

THE NUMERICAL SYSTE,'rf. 427 
many of the other divisions1 of numbers which we £.nd 
in more recent authors2 belong to the ancient Pytha­
gorean doctrine. )Iany uf these ideas, no doubt, really 
belonged to the Pythagoreaus.3 But all these arith­
metical principles, if we except the general di;;tinction 
of odd and even, were far less important in regard to 
the Pythagorean cosmology than to Greek arithmetic, 
which here also followed the direction given to it by 
this school. The imporl::rnce of the decnple system in 
relation to the Pythagoreans is much greater. For rui 
they considered numbers over ten to be only the repe­
tition of the :first ten numbers,4 all numbers and all 
power3 of numbers appeared to them to be comprehended 
in the decad, which is therefore called by Philolaus/ 
great, all-powerful and all-producing, the beginning 
and the guide of the divine and heavenly, as of the 
terrestrial life. According to Aristotle/ it is the 
the relation of which to others is 
only to be definsd by unities, as !) 
and 26.

would be knowable without number, so in pal"ticular, 
we are indebted ~olely to the decad that knowledge is 
possible to us.2 Four has a ~imilar importance, not 
merely bemuse it is the :first square number, but chiefly 
b~cause the four first numbers added together produce 
the perfect number, ten. In the famous Pythagorean 
oath, Pythagoras is therefore celebrated as the revealer 
of the quaternary number (Tetmctys), and t.hi~ in its

seven1 is the only number within the decad which has 
neither factor nor product ; this number is moreover 
compounded out of three and four, the significance of 
which has just been discnssed; lastly~ to pass over other 
things, it is together with four the mean arithmetical 
proportion between one and ten.2 Eight is the first 
cube,3 and tbe great 1'etractys is formed out of the 
four first uneven and the four first even numbers, the 
sum of which (36) equals the sum of the cuhes of one, 
two, and three.• Nine, as the sq_uare of three, and 
the last of the units, must have had a special import­
ance.5 --with the Pythagoreans t,bemselves, of course, 
these arithmetical observations were not separated from 
their other researches on the significance of uumbers; 
and, judging from individual examples, we may suppose 
that they carried them much farther in a mathematical 
gle, according to a.n uncertain tra­
dition. Cf. Alex. ii. 11:l,taph. ( 8,

direction than could be shown in the present exposi­
tion. The later writers, J10wever, give us very little 
certain information on this subject.. Even what I 
have now taken from them very possibly does not 
altogether originate with the ptimitive school, but 
there is no doubt that it truly describes the chatacter 
of the ancient Pythagorean theory of numbers. 
Number and Harmony being with the Pythngoreans 
almost equivalent conceptions, their arithmetical system 
;vas clo8ely connected with their system of Harmony.i 
The different nature of the two spheres however 
necessitated for each a separate mode of treatment. 
\Yhile therefore the numbers were arranged according 
to the number ten, the measure of tones is the octave. 
The chief divisions of the octave are the fourth and the 
fifth : the relation of hmes in it is measmed accol'ding 
to the leogth of the resonant strings, for the fourth 
as 3 4; for the fifth as 2 : 3 ; for the whole odave 
as I : 2.2 Otl1er details, such as the variation of par-•

hn.ve shown that in regm•d to one 
string equally extend~d (tlte mono­
chord en.non, the invcntinn of which 
jg attributed to Pythagoras, Diog.

the length of the vibrating string-. 
llorthius gi,·e, some forthe1• experi­

the ~tory of tlrn smith's hammer is 
manifestly a story which is at on~a

th,~t the height. of the sonnih is 
gi.en ns proportional to the tension 
of the strin:':s, or to the weight, 
which produces this tension . .,-b-ile 
in reality it is only proportional to 
thf. square root of the forees of

l'ythagore:ms held this opinion, 
they could not have based it, upon 
exporiments; but obsfrriiig-in a 
general munner- tlrnt the height of

that this hasty conclusion was

434 .THE PYTHAGOREA.NS. 
After tones, the number theory was next applied 
to geometrical fignres, and it is not nece8sary to be a 
Pythagorean to sec that the form and relations of 
figures are dctermin(;d by numberil. If, therefore, 
the Pythagorean and the Greek mathematicians in 
general were accmtomed to apply geometrical terms 
to numbers,1 and to discover arithmetical and har­
monica! proportions in figures,2 the habit was perfectly 
natural. The Pythagoreans, however, did not stop 
here, but as they saw in numbers generally the essence 
of things, they sought to derive figures and bodies 
iwmediately from definite numbers. Adstotle at any

the straight line is limited by two points, the first 
rectilinear figure by three lines, the simplest regn1ar 
body by four surfaces, whneas the point is au indivfaible 
nnity.1 But by virtue of their general tendencies they 
must necessarily have belie,'ed th<1.t this derivation of 
the figures of l:.oclies involveu a similar derivation of 
the corporeal itself,2 for, a~ we have before remarked,3 
they supposed bodies t.o crm&ist of the lines and planes 
enclosing them, as they supposed lines and figmes to 
consist of numbers. 
According to Philolaus, the elementary nature of 
bodies depends upon their form. Of the five regular 
bodies, therefore, he assigned the cube to the earth, 
the tetmhedron to firn, the ootohcdron to air, the 
icosahedron to water, i.he dodecahedron4 to the fifth

the PlatoJiic doctrine was the same 
on this point as the Pythagorea.n;

4:38 THE PYTHAGORRAXS. 
of the elements belongrn1 to t,he earlier philo;;opher8, 
or was originated by Philolans, and whether in connec­
tion with this the fonr elements, omitting the fifth, came 
from the Pj7thagoreans to Empetloeles, or -::onvl;;rsely 
with the addition of the fifth, from Empedooles to the 
Pythagore~ns, is a qnestion that the historical evidence 
does not enable us to decide; 1 there are grounds, how­
C\'er, for preferring the second of these alternati vcH. 
The theory of Philolaus presupposes too high a develop­
ment of geometrical knowledg·e to be compatible with 
great antiquity, and we shall hereafter find that 
Empedocles was the fin:=t who introduced the more 
accurate conception of the elernentH, and maintained 
that they were four.~ This construction, therefore, 1s 
vrolmbly to be attributed to Philolaus. 
This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that the 
Pythagorean notions concerning the origin and con­
::;titution of the worlr1, so far as W'fl am acquainted with 
them, connect themselves with the otbei~ presuppositions 
of the l'ystem, independently of the doctrine of the 
applifd to the dodecahodmn. C,;,n­
scqnontly, jf this construetion w"re 
mJ.dc the point of departure, it 
would be impossiblo to seo in tlH\ 
dodecahedroo a ~pecific clcmentul'J 
fo1•m ; and, in faet, Plato sets a~ide 
the dodecahedron, Tim. ;'.i;j C, cf. 
,10 A, in a manner which seems to 
imply that this fifth body was 
known to him from anotLsr suurne, 
but that he was unable to mak<> 
uso of it in his exposition. Indo· 
pcndcntly of the Platonic m~thod 
of reducing the elements to certs in 
figures, there existed a set'ond and 
simpler method, rt~ is pro,od by the 
pass!lge in Aristotle, .D£ C[P/o, iii.

element!'. A fragment of Fhil0Ja11s, 1 indeed, in regard 
to the origiu of the world, maintains that the world 
always b[1S l)een, and alway~ will be; which would 
incli~te us to believe the statement 2 that the 'Pythago~

intended only to assert the logical dependence of lht'

tbe universe in time.• But as we have before shown 
the spuriousness of the passage, and as Stokeus does 
not give us the sources or the reasons for his statement; 
no argument can be basfctl on this evidence. On tlw 
other hand, Aristotle distinctly says that none of the 
ea.rlier philosophers held the world to be without begin­
ning, e.:..cept in the scme of the doctrine which is never 
ascribed to the Pythagoreans, viz., that rbe substance of 
the world is eternal and imperishable, but tlmt the world

PORJ'f·ATION OJ.' THE WORLD. 441 
the eternity of the world for the Pyth0,goreau system, 
is attributed by Aristotle to the Phttonists1 only ; 
neither he nor his commentatoni ever mention the 
Pythagoreans in that connection. This would surely 
have been impos,;ible if he had been acquainted with 
an exposition of Philolaus or any other Pythagorean, 
which not only maintained that the world was without 
begim:iiug or end in the most d1:uidcd manner, but on 
the very grounds brought forward in hi;; own system. 
Irrc~pectivcly of this objection, however, it is most im­
probable that thl1 ancient Pythagoriam should ha,·e 
eoncei;-ed the universe as an eternal product oft he ,,orld­
creating energy. The distinction between the logical 
dependence of things on their camms, and their origin 
in time, requires a longer practice and a. finer develop­
ment of thought than we can suppose possiole among 
the eo..rliest thinkers. If they enquired into t1rn origin 
of the world, it was natmal for them to think of its 
commenmment in time : us we see from lhe ancient 
theogouies and cosmogonies. X ot till some time had 
elapserl was it necessary to abandon this point of view, 
and i11en on two considerations : 1. That matter must

be without origin, and 2, that. the world-formiug energy 
can never be conce·ived as inactive. The former idea, as 
far as we know, was first enunciated by Parmenides, the 
latter by Heracleitus ; and the conclusion drawn thence 
even by them and thefr successors was not the eternity 
of our univer~c: Parmenides infefl'ed from his propo­
sition the impossibility of becoming and pas~ing away, 
and a.cco1·dingly he declared the phenomenal world gene­
raUy to be illusion and deception. Heradeitus, Empc­
docles, and Democritus maintained, each in his own 
way, an infinity of worlds of which every one had had a 
beginning in time. Lastly, Anaxagoras, aclo-pting tlrn 
prdinary theory of a sole and uniqne world, supposed this 
likewise to have shaped ifaclf at a defiuite period out of 
the unformed primitive matter. On the other hand, 
Aristotle never thought of attributing a de~cription of 
the origin of the world to the philosophers who main­
tained its eternity so consciously, a.nd on principle, as 
the reputed Philolaus. There is, therefore, little reason 
to doubt that what i$ st.ated concerning the Ijytl:mgorean 
theory of the format.ion of the world really refers to a 
beginning of the wm-ld in time. In fact, any other 
interpretation of the texts fo inadmissible. According 
to the Pythagore:ins, the central fire was first formed 
in the heart nf the universe ; this is also called by 
them the One or the lfonad, because it is the first body 
of the world; the mother of the Gods, because it is this 
which engenders the heavenly bodies ; they also call it 
Hestia, the hem·th or the a1tar of the universe, the 
guard, the citadel or the throne of Zeus, because it is 
the central point in which the world~sustaining energy

the accounts) the system of the uni verse was at last 
finished. 
The universe was conceived by the Pythagoreans 
as a spherc.2 In the centre of the whole they placed, 
as we h.LLve seen, the central fire; around this ten 
heavenly bodied 3 moving from ,vest to east describe 
their orbits ;4 farthest off, the heaven of fixed stars, 
next the five planets ; then the sun, the moon, the 
eart,b, and tenth, and last, the counter-earth, which the 
Pythagorcans in vented in order to complf:te the sacred 
number of ten. The extreme limit of the universe was 
formed by the fire of the periphery, which corresponded 
to the central fire.ti The 8tars they believed were

446 THE PYTHAGORBAJ.'olS. 
Among the 11odies of the universe the central fire 
occupies the fir~t place, not ouly from its position, but 
because, on account of this position, it is the centre of 
gravity and support of the whole, the measure and 
bond of the universe,1 which indeed sprang solely from 
it and throug·h its operation. The Pythagoreans were 
accustomed to conceive all such relations n.ot merely 
mathematically a1.1d mei:htrnically, but at the same 
time dynamical.ly ; we should therefore have e:x:pected 
that they would attribute to the central fire an im­
portant influeIJce upon the whole, even if this were not 
confirmed by the analogy of their doctrine of the forma­
tion of the world, and their opinions (presently to be 
considered) 011 the origin of the fire of the su·n.2 Later 
accounts, however, in eonnection with this, assert that 
the sou.I, or the spirit of the uni verse, was supposed to 
PyLhngoreans. and even t() Pythoi" 
goras, Ui.e thcol'ies of cecsntric 
cirrJes, and epicycles. Kot only

448 TIIE PYTIIAGOREANS. 
Aristotle, in discussing the theories of the ancient 
philosophers about the wul,1 quotes from the Pytha­
goreans only the celebrated asHertion that the pn.rtides 
emanating from the sun are ~ouls, and he infers from 
hence) not without difficulty, that they rcgardeu the 
sonl as the moving· principle. Now it is very improbable 
that Aristotle should have confined himself to this 
apart f,-om what is said in the text, 
:,t onto appe;,,r strnnge that the 
soul (in ag,..,em~nt with Plato and 
Aristotle) shcmld be relegalced to 
the periphery of the world, with­
out mention bting mado of the 
central fire, with whi ~h the author 
ijeerns wholly u<iaequa.intcd. It is 
cquaJly ~t-,.;cngo that. tile soul alld

Pternally moved and tho eternally 
moving (tbe ryth~gol"Cnns con­
sidered the e,,a '""!'-"""' or the

t.rary, they placrd movement on the 
~ide of the 1:nlimited, d. p. 402. I ; 
381, 1). lt is easy to sec in thir a 
1·eprod,1ction of a passage in Plato 
(Orat. 397 e), and uf another in 
Aristot.lf (De A11. 1. 2, yide i,ifra, 
p, 4,58, 4), on Alcmreon, the resnlt 
-Of a misunderstanding. Nor cun 
we fail to recognise tha influence of 
Platonic and Aristotelian ideas in 
the doctrine of the et.cvn:tl mo,e• 
ment of the soul in a eirck, rrnd 
the langu3ge used to expre.ss that 
doctrine. In the cxpo~ition of 
Alexander, and in the short ~U.te­

the doctrine of tlie world-soul to the Pyth~goreans, 
and even if they suppo~ed that heat and vital force 
flowed into the universe from the central fire, this 
ancient materialistic notion is ve.ry different from the 
theory of a world-soul conceived as a part.icular incor­
pore::.l e~aence. 
Around the central fire, the earth, and between the 
two, the counter-earth, revolve in snch a mamier, that 
the earth always turns the same side to the counter­
earth and the central fire ; and for this reason, the ray~ 
of the central fire do not come directly to us, but in­
directly from the ~un. When the earth iH on the 
same side of the central fire as the sun, we have day ; 
when it is on the other side, night.1 Some accounts,

the earth, and make the counter-earth the moon,t or 
tbe second hemisphere of the earth.2 Ent this is 
an erroneous interpret.ation of the old Pythagorean 
doctrine, from the standpoint of later astronomy. It 
is impoRsible tmt these acoounts can be based upon 
any tradition as to the t.heories of the ancient Pytha­
gorc,ins, or of l'ythagoras himself.3 It is only among 
tho sun concrnt 1·ateg and 1•e:flocts1 
not only the light of the central 
fi~e, bnt aim t.Lat of th~ e,ct-Orrn,l 
fo•e. No doubt the 1>,,i8,i'~ would 
not exclude a refla,i,tion of the 
central fae ( as .!lockh ha. 5uf­
ficiently shown, Pkilol. 127 sq.), 
1,11t, on the other han,l, the reflec­
tion of the triple Bun (a doctrin~ 
which could not have come from 
Philolaus hirnsolf, cf. p, 31G) is 
uo proof that the tolar ligbt j~ <~e­
rived from the central fire, and not 
from th8 ihe of t.he periphery. 
Only it would seem that if this 
latter firo can enlighten the sun, 
it must also be visible t,o us. But 
we shdl see further on that 
the Pythagoreans perhaps rei!.lly 
thought they saw this fire i 11 the 
milky way. This heli~faccords with 
the opiuion(contii.ine<l in utl the p>liB· 
sages qu<Jted) ~h:,t the rays of !.his 
lira, as well as those of the central 
fire, arc concentrated and sent back 
by t.be sun, as by a sort of burning

that it should turn its 1vestern hemisphere to the central 
fire.1 At the sawe time, they did not overlook the in­
clination of tbe earth's orbit towards the sun's; 2 this 
was necessary in their cosmical system, not merely to 
explain the changes in the seasons, but because the 
earth would otherwise have every day prevented the 
light of the central fire frow. reaching the sun, by its 
passage between them. Solar eclipses were accounted 
for by the passing of the moon between tbe earth and 
snn ; and lunar eclipses hy the interposition of the 
earth or othei: heavenly bodies between the sun and

THE STARS. 457 
they attributed to the moon, plants and living beings 
far larger and fairer than those on the earth.1 This 
theory was founded, it would seem, partly on the ap.,. 
pcarance of the moon's disc, which resembles the 
earth ; and partly on the desire to discover a special 
abode for the souls who had quitted the earth, and for 
the dxmons. 2 • Also they thought that the stars, which 
like the earth were planets, but which belonged to a 
better portion of the universe, must possess everything 
that serves to adorn the earth, in a more perfect 
manner. Of the planet;;, the order of whicb the

have discovered that Venus is both the morning and the 
evening star.• The heaven of fixed stars, in common 
with tbc other heavenly bodic~, revolves around the 
central fire;~ but as it5 apparent diurnal revolution is 
interrupted by the movement of the earth, the Pytha­
gorea.us must have hero conceived a far longer period 
of revolution, imperceptible in relation ·to the daily 
revolution of the earth : they seem however to have 
been led to this theory not by actual observations, but 
merely by dogmatic presuppositions on the nature of 
the stars.3 They reckoned motion among tho essential 
qualities of the heavenly bodies, and in the unchange­
able regularity of their courses found thi; wost obvious 
proof of the divinity of the stars, in whiuh they believed, 
like most of the ancient~. 4 According to the period of 
revolution attributed to the fi:Ked stars, they seem to

460 TIIR Pl71IAGOREAN8. 
Compared with the ordinary notions of the ancie11ts, 
this theory s1io.vs a remarkable progress iu astronomy. 
For while they, presupposing that the earth was at rest, 
derived the changes of day and night. and the seasons 
exclusively from the suu, an attempt was here first 
made to explain day and night, at any rate, by the 
motion of the earth ; and though the true explanation, 
the revolution of the earth on its axis, was not as yet 
discovered, yet the Pythagorean doctrine in its imme­
diate astronomical res11lt directly led up to this, and 
as soon ns the phantn.stie idea8, which alone resulted 
from the speculative pre,mppositions of Pythagoreanism, 
had been given up~ the counte1'-eaxth as western hemi­
sphere necessarily merged into the earth ; the central 
fire was transferred to the earth's centre, and the move­
ment of the earth aroum.1 the ecntral fire was changed 
into ,t revolution on its o,vn axis.' 
The famous harmony of the spheres was a com,e­
quenee of the movement of the heavenly bodies. For 
as every quickly moved body pmduces a tone, the 
Pyth:-igoreans believed it must be the same with the 
heavenly bodies. They supposed the acut,eness of these 
tones to be according to the rapidity of motion, and 
this again to h!3 in proportion to the tfotance of the 
scvcrn.l planets, the intervals of the planets eonespouded 
with the intervals of sounds in the octave. Thus they 
arrived at tbe theory that the heavenly bodies in their 
may l1a,·c marlo ;j[l solar years

464 THE I'YTHA(JOREANS. 
This notion of the sphernl harmony had no connection 
originally with tbe system of the ten heavenly bodies,1 
but related only to the planets ; for ten tones would 
have resulted from the motion of ten bodies; whereas 
seven sound:,; are required for hannony, according to 
the anciE'nt harmonic system which is based on the 
hcptachord; and eight, if the octachord be adopted. 
Now one or other of these numbers is always assigned 
to tbe harmony of the spheres by all who discuss 
it particularly.' The number must origin:-illy have 
been seven ; for down to the time of Philolaus, the 
Pythagorean theory recognises only the seven uotes 
of the heptachord.3 The tefolt.imony of Aristotle 4 does 
not contradict this. It is possible, in the first place, 
that he had Plato or certain Platonists in his mind as 
music of the 11eavenly bodif'S i~ not 
pereeptibk to the ears of ordinary 
mortals. Porphyry cxpresse~ this 
idea in a phy~ieal manner ( in PloL 
Harm. p. 257) whn1 hfl says t~.<J.t 
our ears arc too narrow to per,:mvc 
these powerful sounds. Arehytas 
seems to hiwe anticiprrteJ I1im in 
this, vide the fmgment quoted in 
Porpb. L c. and supra, p. 306 sq. 
1 Perhaps it is for this reason 
that Philolau8 does not mention it 
(so far, at least, a~ we can discover 
from the fragmrnts that remain of 
him). What Porph. V. Pytlt, 31, 
placing himself at the point of 
,icw of the geocentric system, says 
of the nine sonorous celefiiial 
bodi.e~, eR lled by Pythagoras the 
nine muses, betrays a recent ori­
gin, if only by the un-PythagorPatl 
interpretation of the &.v-rtxewv.

well as the Pythagoreans ; and it is a questioa, in the 
seL:ond place, whether, supposing him to mean the 
Pythagoreans only, he simply reprodul:es their theory 
without any admixture of his own presuppu~itions, 
But the theory of the spheral harmony, thongb it 
primarily related to the planets alone, was ht~ed on 
a universal thought, the very thought that Aristotle 
attributes to the Pythagoreans (1ifetaph. 1, 5), viz., 
that tbP. whole universe is a harmony. This thought 
directly resulted, as we have seen, from tbe perception 
or presentiment of a regular order in the distances and 
movements of the heavenly bodies : what the eye sees 
in observing· the stars, that the ear hears ill the concord 
of tom:H.1 Engrossed with symbols, and little con­
cerned with the prncise discrimination of concept,;, the 
Pythagoreans identified harmony with the octave; 
afteT this it was easy for them to regard the celestial 
harmony abo us an octave, and the seven planets as 
the gulden strings of the heavenly lwptachord. This 
poetical thougbt doubtless ciune first; the intellectual 
arguments which, according to Aristotle, were brought 
forward to justi~y it a.re certainly posterior. 
The chief function of the fire of the circumference, 
in the Pythagorean theory, was to hold the co~ruo~ 
together as a covering embracing the whole~ and on 
this account they seem to have ct1lled it nece~sity.2 It

each other. Thus two <lifferent meanings of the ex­

T.IIE UNIVERSE. 473 
spoken of, but it is uncertain whether he is not hern 
transferring to Olympus what is applicable only to the 
heaYen of fixed stars. 
This astronomical theory of the universe is con­
nected, as we have seen, with the idea of the respiration 
of the world and of its right and left sides. In this 
we see the favourite ancient comparison of the world 
with a living creature; but, after our previous enquiries 
concerning the ,vorld-soul, we cannot allow that this 
thought had any important influence on the Pytha­
gorean system. 
It might be inferred from a passage of the Plcwita 1 
attributed to Plutarch, t1iat the Pytbag·oreans, like 
Anaximander and Herncleitus, believc<l in the periodic 
generation anu destruction of tl1e world. This passage, 
however, probably asserts nothing more than that the 
vapourn into which, by the effect of heat ;;i,ml moisture, 
earthly substanees are re8olvcd, serve for uourisbmeut 
to the -world or t,bc stars.~ It therefore relatC's only to 
the destruction of individual thing~: in regard to the

universe generally, it \Vould appear that tlrn Pytbago­
reans did not believe in any destruction of the world ; 
what the Pseudo-Plutarch1 tells us ou the subject is no 
doubt merely de1·ived from Timreus the Locrian, or 
other similar sources, It is clear on the contrary, from 
Endemns, that they thought, as the Stoics did after­
wards, not only that the same persons who had lived in 
the world would re-ent,er it at a later period ; but that 
they would again <lo the same actions and live in the 
same circumstances; 2 this is confirmed by a passage in 
Porphyry, not in itself of much wcight.3 This theory 
was no doubt connected with the doctrine of Trans­
rnigTation and of the great year of the world : if t.he 
heavenly bodies were to occupy the same place as 
before, everything else would return to the same condi­
tiou, and comcqncnily the same persons would be 
present under the same circumaitanccs. But it is a 
question whether this doctrine belonged to the whole 
school, or only to a portion of it. 
The Pytbagoreans appear to have occupied thern­
selYes very little with the study of terrestrial nature: at 
any rate, with the exception of one slight attempt on 
the part of Philolaus, tradition is silent on the subject.

l'ERRESTRIAL NATURE. TIIE BO[!L. 475 
In regard to Philolans, 1 we are told that in the same 
way that he derived geometrical determinations (the 
point, the line, the surface, the solid) from tbe first four 
rrnmbers, ,;o be derived physical qualities2 from five, the 
soul from six; reason, health, and lig-ht3 from seven; 
love, friendship, prudence, and inventive faculty from 
eight. Herein (apttrt from the numbc1· schcroatisrn) is 
contained the thought that things represent a graduated 
scale of increasing perfection ; but we hear nothing of 
any attempt to prove this in detail, or to seek out the 
characteristics proper to each particular region.~ 
Nor, in all pwbability, did the Pythagoreans carry 
their enquiries rcsprcting the soul and man very fai-. 
Later writers indeed descant much on the origin of the 
soul from the workl-soul, and on its ethereal, divinely­
related, eternally-moved, immoi·t.al natme. 'l'hcre is 
even ,1 fragment of Philolaus which contains these 
statements.;, I have already sbowu,6 however, that this 
fragment can scarcely be considered genuine, and that

aud even to Pythagorn.s. Philoponus connectg with it 
the statement also made by Stobrous, that the soul iG 
a number. 1 This statement in itself is not at all im­
probable: if everything fa number and barruony1 the 
soul may well be so. Eut the general proposition that 
tbo soul is harmony or number, sap nothing ; we only 
get a specific determination concerning the essence of 
the soul, when it is described as by Pfato and ATistotle 
( foe. cit.) as the number or harmony of the bod-y to 
1which i"t belong&, That it was so defined by the 
Pythagoreani,i we are neyer tolfl, and snch a view ,vould 
ill accord with their be.lief in immortality; g it~ there­
fore, it had been found within the school, it would have 
been a departure from the primitive doctrine which we 
cannot ascribe to Philolarn1. It is more likely that he 
said what Claudianus J\Iamertus 3 quotes from him, 
and what may also be deduced from our previous 
citations/ that the soul is united with the body by 
means of number and harmony:; The furtl1er as:iertion,

author.3 It is likewise improbable that Arch,ytas 
de-fined the soul as the self-moved,4 though the Pytha­
goreaus ,vould certainly appear to have noticed its 
continuous motion, and interrupted life ; 5 and the 
statements that Pythagoras called it a square, and 
Archytas a circle or a sphere, are both equally ques­
tionable." Lastly, an expression quoted from Archytas 
to the effect that the soul is not extended in ~pace, is 
no doubt taken from a spmious work.7

ANTHROPOLOGY. 479 
Concerning the -parts of the l'.onl, variom theories are 
ascribed to the Pythagoreans by more recent, writers 
which I cannot admit them to have originally held. 
According to some, they were acquainted with the Pla­
tonic distinct.ion of a rational and an irrational soul, 
and the analogous <listincti:m of Reason, Courage, and 
Desire ; 1 together with the Platonic division of the 
intellectual faculty into vous, J1nffn71i-11, M!a, and 
a'tu-B71(n5'; 2 we are told by anothei-writer3 that they 
divided the soul into Reason, .l\iind, and Courage ( vovs-,

, beasts, Mind in men only; Courage having its s~t in 
the heart, the two other faculties in the brain. There 
is more warrant for supposing that Philolaus placed the 
seat of Reason in the brain ; of life and sensation in 
the licart; of seed and germination in the na\'cl; of 
generation in the ~exnal parts : in the first of thPrn re­
gions, he said, lay the germ of mBn ; · in the second, that 
of beasts ; in the third, that of plants ; in the fourth,

to free ifaelf by a presurn ptnous act.1 So long as the 
soul is in the body it requires the body; for through 
the body alone can it feel and perceive ; scparnted from 
the body it leads an incorporeal life in a higher world.~ 
ThiE, howewr, is of course only the case when it ha8 
rendered itself capable and worthy of such happiness; 
otherwise it can but look forward to the penance of 
material life, or the torments of Tartarns.3 The Pytha­
gorean doctrine was therefore, according to these t.he 
most ancient a11tborities, essentially the same flint we 
afterwards find associated with other .Pythagorean 
notiom, in Pbto; 4 and whieh is maintained by Empe­
docles,5 viz., that the soul on acconnt of preyious frans­
gressions is sent intn the body, and that after death each

486 THE PYTIIAGOREANS. 
complete theory at all 011 the subject. The doctrine 
that each soul returned to earthly life under the same 
circnmstan~es as pre"iously, once in each cosmical 
period, is more distinctly ascribed to them.1 
Important as the belief fo Tnrnsrnigratfon un. 
doubtedly was to the Pythag-oreans,2 it seems to have 
had little connection with their philosophy. Later 
writers seek the point of union in the .tbmight that 
souls, as the effluence of the world.soul, are of a divine 
and therefore imperishable nature ;3 but this thought, 
as lJefore remarked, can hardly be considered a.s be­
longing to the ancient Pythagoreans, since in aU the 
accounts it is bound up with Stoical idea~ and ex­
pressions, and ·neither Aristotle in his treatfae on the 
soul, nor Plato in the Pha:do, ever allude to it, though 
they both had many opportunities for so doing.4 Apart 
from this theory it would be possible to conceive that 
the soul might have been rcgm:ded as an imperishable 
es~cncc, becmrne it was a number or harmony." But 
as the ,mme holds good of all things generally, it would 
involve no special prerogative of the soul above other 
essences. If, on lhe other hand, the soul was in a more 
precise manner com.:eived as the harmony of the body, 
all that could be inferred from this is what Simmias

infers in the Phcedo, that the soul must come to an end 
with the body of which it is the harmony. 1 It seems 
Yery doubtful, therefore, whether the doctrine of immor­
tality and transmigration was scieut.i£cally conneded 
by the Psthagoreans with their theories of the essential 
nature of the soul, or with their nmnber-thcory. Tbe 
etl1ical importance of t.hfa doctrine is undeniable. But 
ethics, as we shall presently sec, was equally r..eglected 
by them, so far as any scientific treatment is concerned. 
This dogma appears therefore to have been, not an ele­
ment of the Pyt,hagore,m philosophy, but a tradition of 
the Pythagorean mysteries, originating probably from 
more ancient orphie traditions/ and having no scientific 
connection with the philosophic principle of the Pytha­
goreans.

to them.1 The opinion that d::emons occupied an inter­
mediate place between gods aud m(m 2 already existed in 
the more ancient popnlar faith. · 
If we tmn from the da:,mons to the gods, ,Ye find, 
as ha~ alrearly been oherved,3 that the Pythag-Mea11S, in 
1111 probability, brought their theology into no ticie11tifie 
connection wit.h their phi1osophica1 principle, That 
tbe conception of God as a religiom idea was of tbe 
higLe»t signi[wance to them, is indubitable ; neverthe­
less, apai-t, from the untrustworthy st.ateml.'n1-s of later 
writers, of which we have before spoken, very little has 
been handed down to m about their peculiar theological 
tenets. Philolans says that en')ry~bing is cnc1o~efi in 
the divinity as in a prison; hi:, is also said to have called 
God the beginning of all things ; and in a fragment 
the authenticity of which is not certain, he de~crihw, him 
in the manner of Xcnophanc~ as the one, eternal, un­
changealilP, 1-tnmoved, 8elf-oomistent rulel' of all things.4 
From this iL is evident tbat he had advanced beyond 
the ordinary polythei,;m to that purer coneeption of 
Deity, which we not unfrequently meet with among 
philosophers and por,t.c; before his time. The story in 
the Pythaw•reau legend,5 that Pythagoras when. h2 went 
jnto Hades &1,v the sou}i:; of Homer and He,:iod under­
going severe torments for their sayings about the gods, 
is to the 8ame effect.. \;Ve cannot., however, by much 
stress upon this, as the date of the story is unknown,

490 THE l'YTHAGOREAl{8. 
Some other particulars are related of Pythagoras and 
his school, 1 which are still more uncertain, and the 
~vidcncc of which collectively proves nothing more 
than we have already admitted, viz., that the Pytha­
g·oreans indeed purified and spiritualised the popular 
belief, and strnngly insisted. on the Unity of the Divine, 
but cannot be said to have consciously attempted t-0 
arrive at any philosophic theory of God. This purifica~ 
tion, however, was not connected in their case, as in the 
case of Xenophanes, with a polemic against the popular 
religion; and though they may not have agreed with 
everything that Homer and Hesiod said about the gods, 
yet the popular religion as a whole fornwd the basis of 
their own theory of the world and of life; in this 
respect it is hardly necessary to refer particularly to 
their worship of Apollo, their connection with the 
Orphics, their predilection for religions symbolism,2 and 
their myths about the lower world, Cons<c,queutly, their 
theological opinions cannot, strictly speaking, be con­
sidered as part of their philosrrphy. 
The religious belief of the l'ythagoreans stood in 
close connection with their moral prescripts. !Inman 
life, they were convinced, wa.s not only, like everything 
1 S11eh as the e::;:pres~i\/11 attri­

which leads to the purification of the soul, from which no 
one, therefore, has any right to depart of his own choice. I 
The essential problem of man's life, consequently, is his 
moral pnrification · and perfection ; and if during his 
earthly life, he is condemned to imperfect effmt; if, 
instead of wisdom, virtue merely, or a struggle for 
wisdom, is possible,2 the only inference is that in this 
struggle man cannot do ,vithout the support which the 
relation to the Deity offers to him. The l'ythagorcan 
ethical doctrine therefore has a thoroughly religious 
character : to follow ·God and to become like Him is· 
its highest p1·inciple.3 But it 8tancls in no closer rela­
tion to their philosophy than their dogmatic doct,rinc 
does. H is of the greatest moment in practical life, 
but its scientific development is confined lo the most 
elementary attempts. Almost the only thing we know 
about it, in this respect, is the definition, already quoted, 
of justice as a ;;quare number, or as <i.vnr,1;7rovB0s, '- But 
that is only an arbitrary application of the method, 
which else.where prevailed in the Pythagorean school­
that of defining the essence of a thing by an analogy

n.ny ·scientific treatment of ethics. The author of the 
.J.lfo.gna 1lforaU,a .says that Pythagoras attempted in­
deed a theory of ,·irt.ue, but in fiO doing, did not arrive 
at the proper nature of ethical activity.1 Vfo must go 
farther and say that the sbmd-poi11t of Pythagort•i.sm 
in general was not that of scienti-6c ethics. Sor can 
we argue much from the proposition 2 that Virtue con­
sists. in IIarmon,y, for the ~ame definition was applied 
by the Pythagoreans to all possible st1bjccts; beside~, 
the date of the proposition is quite uncertain.3 '\Vhether 
the moral. tendency of the myths i1bout the vessel of the 
Da.naids1 which we find in Platoi is really derived frow 
Philolaus or any other Pythagorean is doubtfol,t and if 
it i~, no conclusion ean be drawn from it. From all 
that tradition tells us, it fa evident that ethics with the 
rythagorcans, as with the other Pre-Socratic philoso­
phers, never advanced beyond popular rcflcetion ; in 
regard tn any more developed ethical conceptions, they 
are only to be found 111 the untrustworthy statements of

wlrich partly by their empty diffusiveness, and partly by 
their large use of Jatf:r theories and e.:..prcssions, betray 
their date too clearly to be wodh noticing in this placc.1 
Of the remaining authorities on the ethics of the 
PytbagorcanH, the statements of Aristoxenm merit the 
greatest attention. Thongh he mfLJ perhaps describe 
the principleR of tbe school in his own forms of expreB~ 
sion, and probably not without some admixture of his 
own thoughts, yet on the whole the picture which we 
get frQm him is one which agrees with historical prob­
ability, and with the statements of others. The Pytba­
gorecms, according to Aristoxernrn, requirf'd before all 
things adoration of the gods and of dcemons, and in 
i.11e s.:cond place rnYt-:rence to parents and to tlie laws 
of one's country, which ought not to bR lighlly ex­
changed for foreign laws.2 They regarded lawlessness 
as the greatest evil; for without authority tbeT believed 
the human race could not subsist. Rulers and the 
:rulecl should be united together by love; every citizen 
should have his special place a~sigucd to him in the 
whQle ; boys and yQuths are to be educated for the state, 
adults and old men are to be active in its &ervice.J 
Loyalty, fidelity, and long-suffering in friendship, 
subordination of the young to the olrl, gratitude to 
parents and benefactors are strictly enjoined. 4 There

succeed when it is pursued with love and desire.3 In 
many things man is dependent on Fortune, hut in 
many he is hiroself the lord of his fate.4 In the same 
spirit are the moral prescripts of the Golden Poem. 
Reverence towards the gods and to parents, loyalty to

self-command, di~cretion, purity of life, resignation to 
fate, regular self-examination, prayer, observance of 
consecrating rites, abstinence from impure food,-such 
are the duties for the performance of which the 
Pythagorean book of precepts promises a happy lot 
after death. These, and similar virtues, Pythagoras is

the gods shonld be approached in pure garments and 
with a pure mind; that men should seldom swear, and 
never break their oaths, keep what is entrusted to 
them, avoid wanton desire, and not injure useful plants 
and animals. The long moral declamations which 
Iamblichus puts into his mouth, in many passages of 
his work, 1 for the most part carry out these thoughts: 
they are exhortations to piety, to the maintenance of 
right, morals and law, to moderation, to simplicity, to 
love of country, to respect to parents, to faithfulne3s in 
friendship and marriage, to a harmonious life, full of 
moral ea.rnest.ne&<i. llfany more details of this kind

of our authoritfos, and to whi1t has already been said 
on the political character of the Pythagorean associa­
tion, we may consider it proved that the school of 
Pythag·oras, believing in the almighty power of the 
gods, and in future retribtition, enforced purity of life, 
moderation and justice, mirrnte self'.·examination and 
discretion in all actions, and especially di~couraged 
self-conceit; that it also required unconditional ob­
~ervance of moral order in the family, in the state, in 
friend~}iip, and in general int(:lrconrse. Important, 
ho\Vever, as is the place it thE"reby occupie~ in the

CHARACTER OF PYTHAGOREAN PHILOSOPHY. 497 
order and measure in moral and civil life, were more 
prominent than wit}1 their predecessors ; and we recog­
ni~ed in this a deepening of the moral consciousness, 
which naturally went hand in hand with the contempornry 
revolution in political conditions, and in the intellectual 
life of the Greeks. The transformation and spread of 
the Orphico-Tiacchic mysteries point the same way; for 
U1ey at the same period undoubtedly gained much in 
religious content and historical irnportance.1 To the 
same causes in all probability Pythagoreanism owed its 
rise. The lively sense of the sorrows and short-comings 
inseparable from human existence, in conjunction with 
an earnest moral purpose, seems to have begotten in 
Pythagoras the idea of an associatfon which should lead 
its members by means of religious rites, moral pre­
scripts, and certain special custom~, to purity of life 
and respect for all moral ordinances. It is, therefore, 
quite legitima.t,c to derive PythagornrmiRm in its larger 
~ense-thc Pythagorean association and the Pythagorean 
life-from the moral intf'rest. But it does not follow ···., 
_that the Pythagorean philosophy had also a predomi-
~mntly ethical character/ The Ionic naturalistic phi­
losophy sprang, as we have seen, from the Ionic cities 
with their agitated political life, and from the circle of 
the so-called seveu sages. In the same wa.y the Pytha­
gorean association may have had in the beginning a 
moral and religious end, and :p1t may have given birth 
to a phy~ical theory, since the object of scicnt.ific en­
quiry was at that time the nature of the physical world,

ethical tendency 1 of the Pythagorean life, nor from 
the great number of Pythagorean moral maxim~; for 
the question is not how the Pythagoreaus lived, and 
what they thought right, hut whether, and how far, they 
sought to understand and to account for moral activities 
scientiji,cnlly.2 The conclusion that Pythagoras, in order 
to make life moral, must also have given account to 
himself of the nature of morality,3 is in the highest 
degree uncertain ; it does not at ali follow from his 
practical course of action t,hat }ie reflected in a scientific 
manner upon the general nature of morality, and did 
not., like other reformers and l;tw-givers, content. himself 
with the determination of spechl and immediate pro­
blems. For the same reason the myt,hicnl doctrine of 
hammigration, and the theory of life dependent upon 
it, cannot here be considered ; these are not scientific 
propoRitions~ but religfous dogmas, which moreo\'er 
were not confined to the Pythagorean 5cbool. So far 
as the Pythagorean philosophy is coneerned, I can only 
as~ent to thejudgment of Ari~totle,4 that it was entirely 
devoted to the inve!,tigation of nature. It may be 
objected that this was not pursued in a physical manner;

noo TIIE PYTHAGOREAN&. 
that the object of the Pyt.bagoreans was to enquire how 
law and harmony, morally determim,d by the concepts 
of good and evil, lie in the principles of the universe: 
that all appearfld to them man ethical light, that the 
whole harmony of the world was regulated according to 
moral concepts, and that the entire order of the uni~ 
ver,;e fa to t'hem a development of the first principle 
into virtue and wisdom.1 In reply to this view of 
Pythagoreanism, much may he said. In itself such a 
relation of tlmught to its object is scarce1y conceivable. 
1v\"here scientific en<juiry proceed5 so exclusively from 
an ethical interest, as it is supposed to have done in 
the case of the Pytbagoreans, it must afon, as it would 
seem, have applied ifaelf to ethical questions, and 
produced an independent system of ethics, instead of 
an arithmetical metaphysic, ·and cMmology. But this 
hypothesis also contradicts historical fact. Far from 
having founded their study of nature on moral con­
sideratio-us, they rather reduced the moral clement to 
mathematical and metaphysical concepts, which they 
originally obtained from their observation of nature~ 
resolving virtues into numbers, and the opposition of 
good and evil 2 into that of the limited and unlimited. 
This is not to treat physics ethically, hut ethics 
physically. Schleiermac11er, indeed, would have us 
regard their mathematics as the teclmical p3.1t of their 
ethics. He thinks that al1 virtues and all ethical 
relations were expressed by particular numbers; he sees

an evideutly ethical tendency underlying the table of 
opposites. I But as these assertions are devoid of all 
foundation, it is unnecessary to refute them ; how 
arbitrnry they are, must have already appeared from 
our previous exposi t,ion. Ritter observes, 2 more correctly, 
that Lhc mathematics of the Pythagoreans were con­
nected with their ethics by the general idea of order, 
which is expreBsed in the concept of harmony. The 
only question is whether this order was apprehended in 
their philosophical system as a moral 01· a natmal order. 
The answer cannot be doubtful when we reffoct that, 
so far as scientific determinatious are concerned, the 
Pythagorr.ans sought this order anywhere rather than in 
the actions of men. For it finds its first and most 
immediate expre~sion. in tone~, nex.t in the univer,e ; 
while, on the other hand, no a.ttcmpt i~ made to arrange 
moral activities aeeonling to harmouical proportioirn. 
lt carmot, therefore, be said that the l'ythagoreans 
founded physics and ethics upon a common higher prin­
ciple (that of }mrmony),S for they do not treat this 
principle as equally physical and ethical: it is the iu­
terpretation of nature to which it is primarily applied, 
and for the sake of which it is required ; it is only 
applied to woral life in an acccs,;ory manner, and to a 
far more limited extent.1 Number and harmony have 
here an essentially physical import, and when it is said

002 TIIE PYTHAGOREA.NS, 
that all is nn~nber and harmony, the meaning is not 
that the order of nature is grounded upon a higher 
moral order, it simply expresses the nature of the 
physical world itself: Although, therefore, I willingly 
admit that the Pythagarcans would not perhaps have 
arrived at these definitions if the ethical tendency of 
the Pythagorean association had not quickened their 
sense of measure and harmony,1 yet I cannot on that 
account regard their science itself ns ethical: I must 
consider it in its e~seutial content as purely a system of 
physics. 
Nor· can I allow that the Pythagorean philosophy 
originally sprang from the probh1m of the conditions of 
kno,vleuge, and not from enquiries concerning tI1e 
nature of things: that numbers were rcg,u-ded by the 
Pythagorean;, as the principle of all Being, not because 
they thought they perceived in numerical proportions 
the permam,nt ground of phenomena, but bccauHe, 
without number, nothing seemed to them cognisable: 
a11d, because according to the celebrated principle,' like 
is known by like,' t.he gTound of cognition must also be 
the ground of reality.'' Philulaus, it is true, urges in

proof of his theory of numbers, that without number 
no knmvledge would be possible, that number admits 
of no untruth and alone determines and wakes cog­
nisable the relation~ of things.1 But he has also pre­
,-iously shown,2 quite in an ohjectiv'c manner, that 
everything must he either limited or unlimited, or 
both together, and it is only to prove the necessity of 
the limit that ho brings fonvard this fact among others, 
that without limit r,othing would be knowable. Aris­
totle say& 3 that the Pythagoreans regarded the elements 
of nu1U.bcrs as the elements of all things, because they 
thonght they had discovered a radical similarity between 
numbers and things. This observation, however, indi­
cates that their theory started from the problem of the 
ew~uce of things, rather than that of the conditions of 
knowledge. But the two questions were in fact not 
separated in ancient times; it is the distinctive pecu­
liurity of the Pre-Socratic dogmatism that tbonght 
directs itself to the cognition of the real, without iu­
vestigating its own r{'lation to thP object, or the subjec­
tive forms an<l conditions of knowleuge. Consequently 
no distinction is drawn between the grounds of know­
ledge an<l the gmunds of reality ; the nature of thing~ 
is ,<ought simply in that which is most prominent to 
the philosopher in his contemplation of them ; in that 
which he cannot separate from them in hi:o thought. The

for example, the Eleatics, whose objective starting~ 
point Brandis contrasts with the so-called subjective 
starting-point of the Pythagoreans. Philolaus says that 
all must be number to be cognisable. In the same 
way, Parmenides says that only Being exists, for Being 
alone is the object of 8peech and cognition.1 \Ve can­
not conclude from this that the Eleatics first arrived 
at their metaphysic through their theory of know­
ledge ; nor is the conclusion admissible in the case of 
the Pythagorcans. It could only be so, if they had 
investigated the nature of the faculty of oognition as 
such, apa1t from that of the object of cognition; if 
they had based their number-theory upon a theory of 
the faculty of knowing. Of this, however, there is no 
trace ; 2 for the incidental remark of Philolaus, that 
the sensuous perception is only pos;,ible by means of 
the body,3 even if genuine, cannot. be regarded a,~ a 
fragment of a theory of knowledge, and what later 
writers have relatecl as Pythagorean/ on the distinc­
tion between reason, science, opinion, and sensation,

the Pythagoreans declared mathematical reason to he 
the uritcrion. Had the Pythagorean philosophy started 
from the question-What fa the uncondit.ionally cer­
tain element in our ideas? imtead of the other ques­
tion, Vl''hat is the permanent and essential element 
in things, the cause of their being, and of their quali­
ties ?-the ~·hole system, as Ritter observes,1 would 
have had a dialectic character, or at any rate would 
have been constructed on some basis involving method­
ology and a theory of knowledge. Instead of this, 
AristoUe expressly assures us that the Pythagoreans 
restricted their enquiry entirely to cosmological queH­
tions ; 2 that dialectic and the art of determining the 
coui:;ept were unknown to them as to all the pre­
Socraties~only some slight attempts in that direction 
having been made by them in their numerical ana~ 
logies.3 All that we know of their doctrine can only 
serve to confirm this judgment, The Nco-Pytha­
gorean school adopted and elaborated 1 after their 
sitiou~ of Philolans (quoted above) 
on numhor, as the condition of 
knowledge.

Pytbagoreans as neither dialectical nor ethical philoso­
phers, but purely and simply as Physicists,1 we can but 
agree in the statement, and apprnve of the later writers 
who have followed him in this particnlar.2 
Accordingly om conception of the origin of the 
Pythagorean system must be as follows. From tbe 
spiritual life of the Pythagorean society arose the 
endeavour for au iudepend8nt pursuit of the enquiry 
concerning the causes of things, which had already 
been stimulated .from another side! this enquiry was 
primarily directed by the Pythagorean-s to the expla­
nation of nature, and only secondarily to the establi;;ll­
mcnt of moral activity; but as it se,,med to them that 
law a,nd order were the highest element in human life, 
so in nature it was the order and regular course of 
phenomena, especially as displayed in the heavenly 
bodies, and in the relation of tones which arre~ted 
their attention. They thollght they perceived the 
ground of all reg'ularity and order in the harmonical 
relations of numbers, the scientific investigation of 
which was inaugurated by, them, but which were 
already invested with great power and siguificanee in 
the popular belief of the Greeks. Thus by a natural

CHARACTER OF PYTHAGOREAN PHILOS0l'IIY. 509 
in many different ways in the school we cannot indeed 
arlmit; hut the development of it was certainly not 
from the same type. The table of the ten oppo­
sites belonged, according to Ari~totle, only to sowe, 
who were, it would seem, later Pythagoreans. The 
geometric construction of the elements, an<l the dis­
crimination of four organs and of fow: vital functions in. 
man, were introduced by Philolaus; the doctrine of the 
ten moving heavenly bodies seems to have been less 
ancient than the poetical conception of the spheral 
harmony; as to the relation of particular numbers t-0 
concrete phenomena, little agreement is to be found. 
So far therefore the question might suggest itself, 
whether the Pythagorean system can 1·ightly be spoken 
of as a scientific and historical whole, and if this be 
conceded on account of the unity of the leading 
thoughts, and the recog-nised inter-connection of the 
school, there would still remain the doubt whether the 
system originates with the founder of the Pythagorean 
association; and therefore, whether the Pythagorean 
philosophy is to be classed with the ancient Ionian 
ph,ysical philosophies, or with later systems.1 This 
doubt, however, must not carry us too far. Our his­
torical author ides indeed -allow us to pronounce no de­
finite judgment as to how much of the Pythagorean doc­
trine belonged to Pythagoras himself. Aristotle always 
ascrilies its authorship to the Pythagoreans, never 
to Pythagoras, whose name is not mentioned by him at 
' lt is for this reason that tem, aml that Striimpcll (vide .mp .

all except, in a very few places,1 Later writers2 are 
untrustworthy in proportion as they pretend to a know­
ledge of Pythagoms; and the scanty utterances of 
earlier writers are too indefinite to jnstruct us as to the 
share taken by Pythagoras in the pl1ilosophy of his 
school. Xenophanes alludes to his assertions on tr-.1,ns­
migration as a singularity; 3 but this belief, of which 
Pythagoras can scarcely have been the author, furnishes 
no argument as to hi,; philosophy. Hcra.clcitus men­
tions him 4 as a man who laboured beyond all others to 
amasi-: knowledge, 5 and who by his evil arts, as he ctLlls 
them, gained the reputation of wisdom ; but whether 
this -wisdom consisted in philosophic theories, or in

prnctical efforts, cannot bf'. gathered from his words.

CHARACTER OF P"YTIIA.(.;OREAN PHILOSOPHY. 511 
Empedocles, wbRn he celebrates the ,visdom iu which 
Pythagoras surpassed all men, and foresaw the distant 
future.I But though direct evidence fails us yet on 
general gTOunrls, it is probable that at any rate the 
fundamental thoughts of the system emanated from 
Pythagoras hirnself.2 In the first place this furnishe!l 
the best explanation of the fact that the system, so far 
as we know, was confined to the adherents of Pytha­
goras, aud, among them, was universally disseminated ; 
and moreover, that all that we are told of the Pytl1a­
gorean philosophy, in spite of the differences on minor 
points, agrees iu the main traits. Secondly, the in­
ternal relation of the Pythagorean theory to other 
systems gives us reason to suppose that it originated 
previously to the beginning of the fifth century. 
Among all the later systems, there i8 none in which 
the influence of the Eleatic doubt concerning the 
possibility of Becoming does not manifest itself. Leu­
cippus, Empedodes, and Anaxagoras, however their 
views may differ in other respects, are all at one in 
admitting the first proposition of Parmenides, viz.,

the impossibility of Becoming, and consequently in 
reducing birth and decay to mere change. The Py­
thagoreans might be supposed to be especially open 
to the influence of these profound doctrines of their 
Eleatic neighbours ; but not a trace of this hifluence 
is to be found. Empedocles, who alone, while ad~ 
hering to the Pythagorean life and theology, is as a 
philosopher allied to Paxmeni<les, on this very account 
departs from the Pythagorean school, and becomes the 
author of an independent theory. This tends to prove 
that the Pythagorean philosophy not only did not 
arise out of an attempt to reconcile the Heracleitcan 
and Eleatic doctrines, but that it was not even formed 
under the inflnence of the Eleatic system. On the 
other hand, the Eleatic system seems to presuppose 
Pytbagoreanism; for the abstraction of reducing the 
multitudinous mass of phenomena to the one concept 
of being, is so bold that we cannot avoid seeking for 
some historical preparation for it ; and no system 
adapts itself better to this purpose, as has already been 
shown (p. 204), than the Pythagorean, the principle of 
which is exactly intermediate between the sensible 
intuition of the ancient Ionbns, and the pure thought 
of the Eleatics. That the Pythagorean cosmology was 
known to Parmenidcs, at any rate, is probable from its 
affinity with his own, which will hereafter be noticed. 
, 7fe have, therefore, every reason to believe that the 
Pythagorean theory is earlier than that of Parmenides, 
and that in regard to its main outlines Pythagoras is 
really its author. We shall also preAently find that 
Heracleitus owes not a little to the Samian philosopher

of whom he speaks so harshly, if what he says about 
the ru:ising of all tl1ings from contradictories and from 
harmony, is reully connected with the analogous doc­
t,rines of the Pythagoreans. How far the philosophic 
rleyelopment of doctrine was carried by Pythagoras, 
cannot of course be dis<:overed; but if he is to be 
regarded as the founder of the Pythagorean system, he 
must at least. have. enunciated in some form the funda­
mental definitiom that all is number, that a11 is 
harmony ; that the opposition of the pF-rfect and im­
perfect, the straight and the crooked, pervndes all 
things; and since these definitions them~elves ca.n only 
have arisen in connection with the Pythagorean arith­
metic and music, we mnst also refer the beginning of 
ariLhmdic and music to him. La~tly, we shall find 
that Parmenides p1aced the seat of tbe divinity which 
governs the world in the centre of the uniwrse, and 
made the different spheres revolve around the cent.re ; 
\Ve may therefore ~nppose that the central fire and the 
theory of tLe spheres had aho been early taught by 
the Pythagoreans, though the motion of the earth, the 
cr,nnter-earth, and the precise nnmber of the ten re­
Yoh·ing spheTes were probably of hter origin. 
·whether Pytlrngoras himself had teachers from 
whom his philosophy either who11y or partially sprang·, 
and where these are to be sought, is matter of contro­
versy. As is well known, the later ages of antiquity 
believed him to have derived hi~ doctrines from tho 
East.1 In particular, either Egypt, or Chalrlrea and

Persia, would soonest occnr to the mind; and ancient 
writers especially mention these countries when they 
speak of the travels of Pythagoras in the East. To me 
such an origin of bis doctrine seems unlikely. There is, 
as has been already shown, an utter abseIJ.ce of all trust­
worthy evidence in its favour, and the internal points 
of contact with Pe;sian , and Egyptian philosopl1y, 
which may be found in Pythagoreanism, are not nearly 
sufficient to prove its dependence 11pon these foreign 
influences. ·what Herodotus says of the agreement 
between Pythagoreans and Egyptians I is confined to 
the belief in Lran:;migru.tion, and the cu~Lom of in­
teiring the dead exclusively in linen g·arm.ents. But 
transmigration is found not merely in Plrnrecydes, 
with whose treatise and opinious Pythagoras may have 
been acquainted, if even he were not a scholar of his 
in the technical sense; 2 it 1vas certainly an older 
Orphic tradition,3 and the same may very likely be true 
of the customs in regard to burial: in no case could we 
infer from the appropriation of these religious tra­
ditions the dependence of the. Pythagorean philosophy 
upon the alleged wisdom of the Egyptian priests. Of 
the distinctive principle of this system, the number­
theory, we find no trace among the Egyptians ; the 
parallels, too, which might be drawn betweim the 
Egyptian and Pythagorean cosmology are much too in­
definite to prove any close historical intf'rconnection 
between them: and the same hold~ good of the Pytha­
gorean symbolism, in which some have also seen traces

of Egyptian origin.1 The sy;;tcm of caste and other 
social institutions of the Egyptians were not imitated 
by the Pyt11agoream;. ,ve might indeed compare t.he 
zeal of these philosophers for the maintenance and re­
storation of ancient customs and insl,itutions, with the 
fixed invariability of the Egyptian character; but 
the reasons of this phenomenon lie nearer to hand in 
the circumstances and traditions of the colonies of 
Magna Gnecia ; and the diffe1·ence of the Doric and 
Pythagorean element from the Egyptian is, on closer 
observation, so important, that there is no warrant for 
deriving the one from the other. 'fhe same may be 
said of the Persian doctrines. The Pythagorean oppo­
sition of the uneven and the even, of the better and 
the worse, &c., might find ;1 parallel in the Persian 
dualism ; and it is apparently this similarity which 
gave occasion, in ancient times, to the theory that the 
:Magi, or even Zoroa.ster, were the teacher8 of Pytha­
goras. But it surely did not require foreign instruc­
tion to observe that good and evil, str!l.ight and crooked, 
masculine and feminine, right and left, exist in the 
world ; the specific manner, however, in which the 
Pythagoreans designated these opposites ; their reduc­
tion to t~rn fundamental oppositions of the uneven and 
the even, the limited and unlimited, the decuple classi­
fication, generally speaking, the philosophic and mathe­
matical treatment of the subjcot, is as foreign to the 
doctrine of Zoroaster as the theological dualism of a good 
and evil Deity is foreign to Pythagorcanism. Other 
similarities which might be adduced~ snch as the signifi-

cance of the number seven, the belief in a future exist­
ence, and many ethieal and religious apophthegms collec­
tively, prove so little, and rliffer from each other so greatly 
as to details, that they cannot be tlfacussed in this place. 
The life and scieMe of the Pythagorean~ are only 
really to be understood in connection with the &pccitic 
character and conditions of culture of the Greek people 
in the sixth Cfmtury. P:ytbagoreanism, as an attempt at 
an ethico-religious reform,1 muRt be claBsed with other 
endeavours which we meet with contemporaneously m· 
previously in the work of Rpimenides and Onomacritus, 
in the rise of mysteries, in the wisdom of the Ho-called 
seven wise men, and of the Gnomic poets ; and it is 
distinguished from all slmilar phenomena by the 
manysidedness and force with which it embraced all 
the elements of cultme of the time, religious, ethical, 
political, and scientific, and at the same tiwe created 
for itself, in a close society, a fixed nucleus and aim for 
its activity. Its more precise clmracterist.ics resulted 
from its connection with the Doric race and Doric 
institutions. 2 Pythagoras hi msrlf, it is true, came from 
the Ionian island of Samos, but as we have already Geen, 
it is probable that his parenb, though of Tyrrhene race, 
had emigrated thithc1· from Phlius in Peloponnesus, 
and the principal theatre of bis own activity was in 
Doric and Acbrean cities. At a11y rate bis work displays 
the essential traits of the Doric character. The worship

Syssitia, the gymnastics, the ethical music, the prover­
bial wisdom of the PyLhagoreans, the participation of 
women in the education and society of men, the strict 
and measured moral code, which knows no higher duties 
than the subordination of the individual to the whole, 
respect for traditional customs and laws, reverence for 
parents, for constituted anthority, and for old age-all 
this plainly shows us how great a. share the Doric spirit 
had in the origination aml development of Pytliago~ 
reanisrn. That this spirit is alsQ unmistakeable in tile 
Pythagorean philosophy has already been observed ; 1 
hut the union in Pythagoras of a scientific effort for 
the inlel'pretation of nature, with his moral and religious 
activity, is probably due to the intluenue of the Ionic 
physiologists, who could not have been unknown to a 
man so erndite aml so far beyond all his contemporaries 2 
in his passion fot knowledge. The statement, \Jowevcr1 
that Anaximander was riis instructor 3 can scarcely be 
n10re than a conjecture, hm;ed on chronological proba­
bility and not on any actual tradition. But it is very 
likely that be may ha,ve been acquainted with his elder 
contemporary, who was so prominent among the earliest 
philo~uphern, whether we suppose the o.cquaiutance tc 
have been personal, or merely through Anaximander's 
writings. The influence of Anaxim,wder may perhaps 
be traced, not only in tbe genera! impulse toward~ the 
study of the cause~ of 1.,be uni11erse) but also in the 
Pythagorean theory of the spheres (vide p. 445, 1 ),

Grecian colonies themselves, as is proved by the growth 
it there attaim . .J., and by all that we know of tlie 
culture of these cities. If further proof, however, be 
required, it lies in the fact that, contemporaneously 
with the Pythagorean, another brnnch of Italian philo­
sophy was developed, which also owed its origin to an 
Ionian. Bnt before we proceed to examine this ,;ystern, 
we must direct our attention to certain men who have 
a connection with Pythagoreanism, although we cannot 
precisely include them in the Pythagorean school.

not only of isolated astronomical 1 and ethical pro­
positiorn,2 but also of g·eneral philosophical theories 
which are very closely allied to those of the Pytha­

on the one b,rnd, the opposition between the perfect or 
celestial, and the imperfect or terrestrial ; and on the 
other, the spiritual affinity of man with the eternal.

librium of opposite forces; v;,heu, on the contrary, one 
of its elements g,tills a preponderance over the others, 
Eickne~s and death are the result.1 V{e certainly cannot 
eonsir1er Alcmmon a Pytlrngorean because of these pro­
positions, for we find nothing about the number-theory, 
the diEtinctive doctrine of thti Pythagorean system, in 
any of our accounts of him. Moreover, his astronomi­
cal opinions, mentioned above, only partially agree with 
the Pythagorean cosmology; and we must, therefore, 
hold Aristotle to be in the right when he discriminates 
him from the Pythagoreans. Bnt the obsen-ations of 
Alcmreon on the relation of the eternal and the mortal, 
on the oppositions in the world, on the divinity of the 
st,1rs, and the immortality of the soul, coincide in 
substance almost ex:actly with the Pythagorean doctrine. 
That a contemporary of the Pythagoreans, from their· 
especial city Crotona, should have arrived at these 
theories independently of Pythagoreanism, is incredible. 
Altl1Qugb, therefore, Aristotle docs not venture to 
decide whether the doctrine of opposites came from 
the Pythagoreans to Alcmreon, or vice 1Jersa, the former 
alt1cruative is much t1rn more probable ; 2 and we accord-

ingly regard Alcmreon as a man who was con£-iderably 
influenced by the .Pythagorean philosophy, without 
having actually adopted it in its totality. 
Respecting Hippasus and Ecp11antu;; our inform~­
t.ion is ~till more scanty. A~ to the former, the ancient 
writers themselves seem to have known no more than i;.; 
to be found in Aristotle-namely, that, like Heraclcitu;i:, 
he held fire to be the primitive rnatter.1 The farther 
statements, that he declared fire to be the Deity ; 2 
that he made deri vecl things arise out of fire by mre­
faciion au.d conden!oation; 3 that he thought the soul wa~ 
of a fiery nature ; 4 that the world 1.-as limited and 
eternally moved, and subject to a periodic transforma­
tion: 5 all these must be mere inferences from the 
comparison of him with IIeracleitus, since even the 
scholars of the Ale.xandria.n epoch p0ssesse<l no writing 
of his.6 It was perhaps this approximation to the 
I-Ieracleitean doctrine which made later writers call him 
a spurious Pythagorean, and the head of the so-called 
oprosites, but only 0£ the g~mT&l 
princirle that everything is full of 
<.lpposites.

Acnsmatics ; 1 elsewhere he is spokeu of purely and 
simply as a Pythagorean,2 and fragments of writings are 
adduced which were falsely attributed to him on this 
supposition.a If we enquire by what means he could 
have been led, as a Pythagorea.n, to the theory ascribed 
to birn, it is most obvious to think of the doctrine of 
the central fire, According to tlle Pythagoreaus, this 
fire was the germ of the universe, to which everything 
else_ had reference; and Hippasus seems for this reason 
to have regarded it as the matter of which all things 
consist. There is every probability, however, that he 
was also influenced by the example of Heracleitus, and 
that his theory thus resulted from a combination of the 
Pythagoreau and Heracleitean doctrine. 
Ecphantus occupies a similar position. He, too, is 
included among the Pythagoreans ; 1 but their number­
theory appears to have been too abstract and un­
physical for him, and he therefore sought, like Hippasus, 
to complete it with the theories of later physicists; 
only that imt.ead of Heracleit1.1s, he chose the Atomistic 
philosophy and Anaxagoras; influenced perhaps hy the 
Pythagorean derivation of space-magnitudes. He 
understood by the units, which are the original con~ 
stituents of numbers, and furthermore of all things,

material atoms, differing among themseh'es in size, 
form, and force. 1'he proposition ( which we must 
understand in the sense of the analogous sayings of 
Democritus 1 ), that the essence of things cannot be 
known (that is, sensibly perceived), probably refers to 
thfl invisibility of these atoms. To the atoms he added 
the void-a conception alrcarly recognised in the 
ancient Pythagorean doctrine-but this did not appear 
to him sufficient as au explanation of phenomena, or 
el8e Pythagorean piety prevented his resting iu it; 
he therefore assumed, with Anaxagoras, that the move­
ment of the atoms and the shaping of the universe was 
produced by miml or the soul. On account of the 
unity of this moving mmse, he preferred the ordinary 
notion of the unity and spherical shape of the world to 
the atomistic theory of many worlds.2 All this, how­
fwer, shows that he must have belonged to the latest 
generatiom, of the Pyt1rngoreans, with whom he is also 
identified by the statement that., in agreement with

THE ELEATICS. 
name of Aristotle, which expounds and criticises the 
doctrines of tw,:i Eleatic philosophers, and the Bimilar 
arguments of Gorgias. But who thei;e two philoso­
pher5 are, and what is the historical valne of the trea­
tise, there is no certain eviden!!e to show. The greater 
number of texts give the title of the work th.,s: < Con­
cerning Xenophanes, Zeno and G-orgias.' Others have 
only the mme general title, '-Concerning the opinions/ 
or 'Concerning the opiuions of the philosophers.' Of 
the pmticuhr divisions of this work, the firnt section 
( c. 1, 2) i8 usually thought to relate to Xenophanes; 
but in ~ome of the manu,.;cript~, and especially in the 
Leipzig Codex, which is the hest, to Zeno: while the 
second section ( c, :1i 4 ), to which the name of Zeno is 
most frequently attached, fa referred hy the same 
a.uthorities to Xenorihancs, 1 There can be no doubt, 
however, tlmt the fast section tre«ts 11either of Xeno­
phanes nor of Zeno, but of ::.Udissus. This is clearly 
asserted~ in the work itself, and the content~ are of 
such a nature t.lml they cuu relate to DO otlrnr person. 
For as we learn from the expre~s testimony of Aris­

from a dogmatic point of view. Just as m a. famous 
passage of i:hc 11Ietaphysics, Aristotle rueutioos Par­
menidcs £rst, then 1:Ielissus, and after them Xeno­
phanes; 1 so, in tb.is work) the author deals first with 
thosB Elealics who maintain that Reing is limiterl-viz., 
Zeno, an<l 110 do11bl.. Parmenides; 2 next with nlelissm, 
who also rnaiutains that it is uulirnited; next with 
Xenophanes, who say~ that it is neither limited nor un­
limited; and, lastly, with Gorgias, who not only denies 
that Being is cognisable, but a.ho denies Being it~elf. But 
if this destroys tlie theory that Zeno is t.hc philo,ioplwr 
indic;"J,ted in the third chapter/ still fo"~ can we discoYer 
in the exposition any accurate aceount of his doctrines.'1 
The philosopher here mentioned is repre~ented a~ hllYing

general application. No Buch restrieti,m of Zeno's doc­
trines is recognised by any of the ancienL accounts: 
they all agree that Zeno, like Pannenides, denied Be­
coming and J\I:ultiplicity in general. Xenophanes alone, 
as we shall see, connected his whole polemic ugain;;t the 
ordinary point of view with the theological question; 
whereas, with the exception of what we find in the 
treatise we are considering, not a sing-le theological pro­
position has been handed dO\"in to us as Zeno'~. Al­
tlio11gh, therefore, it is quite conccb;aule that Zeno 
mfly bavc called the One Being also G6d, yet it is not 
probable tktt in hi$ dcmomtration he limited himself 
to proving that the Ddl,lJ is eternal, sole, &c. On the 
contmry, what be a.iirn,d at was to show generally that 
Plurality aud Beeoming arc nowhere po~sible.1 Our 
text (lonscqurmt.ly maintains, in reBpect of Uie Eleatic 
philosopher it discusse~, that ,vhid1 could only be said 
of Xcnophanes; and the further c!e,·elopment of hi.;

true that Parmcnidcs and }IelissnR attributi? to Beiug 
the same unity, uniformity, and immobility, that 
Xenophanes rloes to God. But the fact that tLey attri­
bute the;;e qm1.lities not to God, but to Being, shows 
wost clearly how grnat ·was the advance from Xeno­
phanes to Parmeuides. There is no doubt tbat · Zeno 
strictly adhered to the doctrine of Parmenides. T]rnt 
he should have abandoned the mebiphysical view of the 
fundamental doctrine of the Elcat.ic;1 wherein the chief 
merit of Parmenides consists, and should have gone hwk 
to the more impei·foct theolog·ica1 view, is not probable. 
But the m<1nner in which the Deity is here spoken 
of is no le~s snrprfaiug-. It is described as neither 
limited nor unlimited, ncill1er moved nor unmoved; hLtt 
although it is witlrnut limit, it is said to be ~pherical in 
form. How is this po~sible? Iu his critique of ordinary 
opinion, Zeno regards as a sufficient proof of its falsity 
the fact that it aLtrilmtes opposite predicate;; to the 
1:,ame things at tlie sawe tiw.e.1 Is it likely then thut 
he himself would have attributed such mutually ex­
clusive prndicates to the Deity ? Ueberweg· thinks 
that he clicl not intend to attribute them, but to deny 
them, in order thus to exalt the Deity above the whole 
sphere of cxtenr;ion and tempc,rality.2 .But this inten-
onpposilion thui he clid not lwlcl a

tion fa :,o little shown by our Eleatic philosopher, that 
he expressly descri'oes the Deity as globe-shaped; the 
historical Zeno, moreovel', denies all reality to that 
which is not cxtended.1 It is incredible that Zeno 
8hould have maintained these theories of his master, 
if the idea of God being nncontained in spnce were 
admitted hy him; and still more incrcdihlc is it that 
so i1cute a thinker should haYe believed in the spherical 
form, while he denied the limitation of the Deity. 
Internal contradictions can be diseoverecl in Zeno as 
in other philosophers, but they can be 'recognised as 
ccrntradictions only by means of inferences which he 
did not himself draw. 'l'hel'e iH no example in his

the Deity is spherical. Mol'eover, it is highly impro­
bable that Aristotle should ha.Ye passed over such a 
singuhr opinion in passages like Metaph. i. 5, Phys. 
i. 3. We know that as late as the third century of our 
era the most learned commentators of Aristotle were not 
agreed whether Xonophanes held the Deity to be limited 
or unlimited; 1 and this phenomenon would be incom­
prehensible if they had possessed, in addition to the 
work of Ari3totle, such definite and detailed e:s:plana-

plurn~s. in th~ fiphorical form which 
he attl'ibutr.d te> God, meant to 
imply ,he unity of the Limited

~elf-lilllitetl; and when lrn denied 
th<l-t God was unmoved h~ was 
merely ,issorting that G-od has no 
perm,ment rcl,1tion to another. The 
possibility of such a meaning in 
these defi11itio11s, however, could 
uot easily Le proved; it is besides 
far too subtle for so ancient a 
thinker, Ker11'8 iote1·protat.ion 
(Beitr. 17; cf. Xe,wpk. 10 ~qq.) is 
equally untenable ; 'Xenophanes 
denied Limitedlless only within 
lleing and in opposition to a some­
thing cast out from Being and exc­
tcrm1l t0 it, and Unlimitedne88 
only in relation to the One which

apart from the contents of this exprn;ition, it is unlikely 
that. there ever was such a work. A dialectical discm::­
~ion so methodically conducted, and proceeding in so 
reg·ular a manner from beginning to end in the scholas­
tic form of a refutation, by means of dilemmas and 
ded1.wtio ad absurdum, could not, except in defiance of 
all laws of historical analogy, 3 be ascribed to the prede­
cessor of Parmenides, to the philosopher whom Aristotle 
censures 4 for his want of practice in tboug"ht. 
1 That this may be the c:ise. 
cYen Branrlis admits ( Gesah.d.F.ntw. 
i. 83), when h,:i says that the ,mthor 
may haw brought together all th«t 
was isolated or loo.~ely coonected 
in the poem. Cf. Kern, Q,,t. p, 52, 
wbo says that the words a11d many 
pn.rts of the argum~nt may 1,elong 
to the antlior. ·where is our 
guarantee tb'lt the author lws, in 
other re~pects, truly reproduced 
the doct,rine of Xenophrrnes? 1Vo 
,ball find no such guarantee in the 
n.nt.hor's name 1 for -it is q1wstion­
able whether the treat.is~ has any 
right to it ; nor ( ~ido following 
note) in the poelic~l expressions 
on which Brandis bases his ,iew. 
' Brandis, l. c. 8~, believed be 
could point out in this work a 
numbn of forms manifo,Uy poeti­
cal and corresponding with some 
in the fragments of Xenophanes. 
But Kem, Qu. 52, re,marks that of 
those he quotes only the word

f.u,, e,·€n ~nppo,;ing they did, there 
would st.ill tie a great differ~nce

with Kern: 'C11r prmUo ante Par.

that no rlia1ectit.al method can ha,·e

If. h:,wever, Xenophancs had really

554 THE ELEATICS. 
genuineness of this work from its main contents is con­
firmed by these secondary traits; and if neither of 
them separately is decisive, yet together they constitute 
an amount of circnmFfantial evidence which cannot be 
outweighed by the testimony of manuscripts and later 
authors, so often found on the side of undoubtedly 
spurious writing~. 
When and by whom tbe three treatises were com­
posed is uncertain. That they emanated from the 
Peripatetic school is probable, both from their nature 
and al~o from the mention of them in the catalogue of 
Diogenes. 1 They appear to have included two frag­
ments, which have been lost, on llarmenidos and Zeno ;2 
so that the author must have aimed ;1t. a complete 
representation and criticisw of the Eleatic doetrines. 
The order adopted in their discussion .:eems to havP. 
been that indicated in the passage from Aristotle 
quoted above/ except that Zeno and Gorgias are added 
to the philosophers there mentioned. The author has 
taken their opinions cl1iefly from their own writing~, 
and has giyen the essential content of these cor~ 
rectly when it presented itself t.o him in the form of 
an arbruwent logically developed, as was the case with 
Melissus and Gorgias. In regard to Xenophanes, on 
the contrary, he appears to have mi,rapprehemled the 
statements of Aristotle and Theophrast.us,t awl to haYc 
started from the presupposition that this philosopher 
the nrscs in whiel1 Empedatfos 
c-ensu:rcs thfa utterance.

and then to have developed the proofs of this statement 
froi:u the indicatiom which he found, or thought he

him iu so doing, ancl that this exposition, and not 
Xenophanes him::1elf, may have becm his immediate

with other accounts. Its te~timony as to suppo~ed 
propofitions of his is not sufficieut to cstahlisb their 
authenticity in ca~e;; where it stands alone. 
The development of the Eleutic philowphy was 
.completed in three generations of vhilo."'ophcrs, who:e;e 
activity exten<led over about a century. Xenophaue~, 
ihe founder of the school, first expresses their generai 
principle in a theological form, In opposition to Poly­
theis1;1, he declares the Deity to be the One, undcrivcd, 
all-embracing Being; and in connection with this, the 
universe to be uniform and eternal. At the same timf\ 
however, be recognises the :Many and the 'i\iutable as a 
reality. Parmenides gives to this principle its meta­
physical basis and pmely philosophic expression; he 
reduces the opposites of the One and the Mauy, the 
Eternal and the Become, to the fundamental opposite 
of the Existent and non-Exi;;t.ent; derives the qualities 
of both from their concept, and proves the impos:c;ihility 
of Recoming, Change and Plurality in a st.rictly nni­
versal sense. Lastly, Zeno and l\Ielissus maintain the 
propositions of Parmenides as against the ordinary

his didactic poem theological opinions are predominant, 
and only a few physical theories are introduced, lhe 
ancient writers ascribe to him general metaphysical 
stu.tcments which closely connect him with his snccessor

kind is incompatible with the pure theism of Xcno­
plrnncs.1 How do we kDow that his assertions of the 
unity, eternity, unlirnitedness, and spiritnality of God 
were intended to be uadentood in a theistic, and not. 
in a panHieictlc sense? His own expressions leave this 
quite undecided ; but the probabilities, even flpart from 
the testimony of the ancients, are in fayour of the 
pantheistic view. For the Greek gods are merely 
personified powers of nature and of human life; and, 
therefore, it was much more obvious for a philo"opher 
who objected to their plurality to unite them ill 
t.l1e conception of universal physical force, than in the 
idea of a God external to the world. Thus we ha.Ye

asst:rt at the ~amc time the unity of the world ; ond 
from Lb point of view it is easy to see how the second 
of these as~crtions would appear to be directly involved 
in the first. In his speculations on the cause of all 
things, ]ie sought that cause, herein agreeing with t.he 
popnlar faith, primarily in tbe rule of the gods. Rnt 
he could not reconcile their plurality, restriction, and an­
thropomorphic nature with his concept of Deity. At 
the same time, the unity of the world, which even to the 
sensible intuit.ion asseds itself in tbe app;i,rrnt limita~ 
tion of tlrn world by the vault of heaven, and which 
deeper reflection discerns in the likeness and inter­
conn1;,ction of phenomena, seemed to him to r.ece%itate 
the unity of the force that formed the world,1-wbkh 
force he did not concein: as separate from the world. 
God aml the world an:i here related to one another as 
essence and phenomenon. If God j3 One, things ac­
cording to their essential nat.ure mnst be One ; and 
convenmly the polytheistic religion of nature becomes 
a philosophic pa.ntheism. 
In connection with his doctrine of the unity of 
God, Xenophanes is said to have described the Deity 
as homogeneous ; in other ,vordi:!, he maintained the 
qualitative simpleness (Einfo,chheit) of the divine 
essence simultaneously with its unity. Although, how-

in this form merely an inference from the words used

sphere.1 But the very contradiction between t.hese two 
sayings proves that they are not scientific propositions, 
but incidental utterances which occurred in different 
portions of the poems of Xenophanes. He may at one 
time have spoken of the spherical form of the heavens, 
and at another, of the immeasureablc extent of the 
world beneath, and of the space of tbe air above, 
without troubling himself about the mutual compati­
bility of these two conceptions. N,1r is it probable 
that he meant to express by either of them any fi:x:ed 
conviction in regard to the ~hape and extension of t,he 
world-still less th,1t they had reference to the Deity. 
The statement that he declared the world to be un­
derived, eternal, and imperisbable,2 may, with more 
reason, remind us of the similar definitions of the 
Deity. The eternity of the world migM seem to him 
to he implied in that of God, because God was to him 
the immanent uause of tbe world. Ent he appears to 
have attributed eternity to the world, only in a general 
manner, in regard to its suh,tance ; and not to have 
taught, as a consequence of this, that the universe 
in its p~esent condition was unclerived.3 Also the pro­
position that the All remained like to itself4 may have 
been enunciated by him in regard to the regularity of 
the course of the world and the invariableness of the 
universe. But that be absolutely denied all genera­
tion and destruction, all change and movement in the

world, as more recent authors as,.;ert, 1 we cannot think 
possible. There is no mention of such a denial in 
ancient authorities or in the fragments of Xenophanes' 
writings ; 2 und, moreover, a number of statements of 
a physical nature respecting the origin of individual 
things, and the changes of the material earth are 
attributed to thi~ philosopher, while no remark is 
ever made 3 in connection with these that, like Panne­
nides in his physics, Xenophanes was speaking of illu­
sory phenomena, and not of the reality. None of 
our authorities maintain that he opposed Being to non­
Being in the manner .of bis successor, or taught that 
Being alone was reality. 
These physical theories of Xenophanes have scarcely 
any connection with the fundamental ideas of bis philo­
sophy. They are isolated observations and conjectures, 
sometimes pregnant and suggci;tivc, but sometimes of 
a rudimentary and child-like kind, such as we might 
e:x:pect in the commencement of natural science. ·we 
will now, however, shortly state what ha~ heen preserved 
of them. 
According t-0 some, Xenophanes said that earth was 
the primitive substance of all things ; according to 
otbers, earth and water.4 But the verses 011 which

these statements are founrled appea1· to deal only with

stotle, in ·enumerating the elementary primitive sub­
stances of tl1e ancient philosophers, r;_ot merely does 
not mention Xenophanes, ,but say~ 3 that none of tl10ce 
philosophers who admitted only one primitive sub­
st.uncc, adopted the earth as such. Thus he expressly 
exclude~ the first of the above statement~; and we 
cannot suppose him to be confirming the seco:1d ( when 
he names the dry and the moid among the primitive 
subEtances ;5 for he repeate•Uy desigwites Parmenides 
as the only philosopher of the Eleatics who, :-ide by 
side with tbe One rnb~tauce, admitted two opposite 
elements;6 On. the other h,u1d, later writers had some 
reason for interpreting the verse of Xcnophanes in this 
sense, since Xenophanes supposed. the stais (r.ricie infra) 
to or,iginate from the vapours of the earth a.ud water.

tnay, perhaps, be in conaeque:o.ce of a ,,imilar miHapprc­
hension that the doctrine of the four elements co.me to 
be a~cribed to him.1 It was, no doubt, easy for l.ater 
writers to find their four primitive elenwntti in every 
cosmology; but this doctrine is distinctly asserted by 
Aristotle~ to have Ol'iginated ,vith Empedocles, tmd its 
connection with the metaphysics of Parmenidcs is too 
ohviou~ for us to :,;upposc that a predecessor of Parme-
1.1ides ~huuld not merely have mentioned in an inci­
dental manner fire, water, etc., but should have ex­
pressly designated the four elements as the basis of all 
compound bodies. 
There is, duuLtless, more foundation for the theory 
that Xcnophanes supposed the earth to have passed 
from a fluid condition into its pre;;ent solid sta.tc, f!nd 
that in time it would again by means of water be 
chunged irito wud. He Lad observed petrified marine 
creatures on land, and B\'Cil on mountains, and knew 
not how to account for thiR phenomenon except on the 
suppo5ition that the world, 01· at any rntc the surface 
of the world) wns subject to a P("riodical transition 
from the fluid statB to the solid, and bade to the fluid 
state again; in which transition the human race, to­

word as tie1·y clouds,1 which at their setting ,vere extin­
guished Like embers, and at their rising were kindled,2 
or rather formed, anew; 3 this occurred likewise, he 
thought, in solar and hLnar edipses.4 These maxses 
of vapour (this is, at any rnte, expressly said in regard 
to the sun) were not supposed to move in a circle 
arnund the earth, but in an endless straight line above 
it ; arn.l if the course appears to us eircnlar, this is 
only an optical delusion, as in the case of the other 
clouds which, when they approach the zenith, s:ern to 
our eyes to ascend, and when they go under the horiwn, 
to sink. It follows from this that new stars must he 
continually 3.ppcaring above our horiwn, and that parts 
of the earth widely separated from each other must Le 
enlightened by different sun~ 5 and moons.

ethical portions of his fragments cannot, strictly speak­
ing, be included in his pbilo~ophy, because admirahle 
and philosophical as fa the spirit revealed in them, he 
never brought his ethics into scientific <lonneetion with 
the twivernul bases of his cosmical theory. The poet 
censures the former luxury of his compatriots; 1 he 
deplores on the other hand that bodily strength and 
agility bring more honour to a man than wisdom, which 
i~ far more valuable to the state;~ he disa.pproves orttlrn 
as a means of proof, because he see~ in them a reward 
for godlessness. 3 He advocates cheerful foasfa, seasoned 
with pious and instructive talk, but he condemns empty 
eonversation, together with the mythical creations of 
tho poets.4 Although this betrays the frieud of s~ience 
and the enemy of m,rths, yet on the wLole these say­
ings do not transcend the point of view of the popular 
gnomic wisdom. It -vmuld be more important, were 
the a~8ertion correct, that X.cnophanes either wholly 
dt-mied the possibility of knowledge, or restricted it to 
foe doctrine of the Deity; or, as other;; say, that he 
recognised the truth of the perception of reason only, 
and not of the percrption of sense. 0 The expressions,

thinks that perfect certainty of knowledge fa not pos­

so ; and, therefore, Xenophancs deaignates his own

arose, no doubt, from a sceptical temperament. For 
the uncertainty of knowledge L, not here based on a 
general enquiry into the intellectrral faculty of man, it 
is simply maintained as the result of per.,onal erperi­
cuce; comequently, the philosop11cr is not hindered, hy 
the consideration of it, from advancing his theological 
and plqs_ical propositions with full conviction. Even 
the later division of the cognition of reason from the 
<lecepti ve perception of sense has not been made as yet 
-philosophic theories are placed on an cq1.ia1ity with 
all other theories; for this division is founded hy the 
Eleatics on the denial of Becoming and Plurality which 
the senses show us ; and to this denial, as we have 
ahe:,,dy seen, Xenophanes did not proceed.1

by (Jonsin, p. 48 sq .. a.,ld by Koru,

CHARACTER OF HIS DOCTRINE. 577 
There is all the less reason for ascribing to him, as 
some of the ancient writers do, logical enquiries as well 
as physical/ or for classing him with the later Eristics.2 
His doctrine is rather Physics in the ancient and more 
comprehensive sense, and though it is for remo.-ed 
from other purely physical theories, yet its physical 
character comes out so clearly, when we compare it with 
the more ab~tmct prnpositions of Parmcnides, that it 
has been not inaptly described as the link of transition 
from the Ionian enquiry to the completed Eleatic doc­
trine of pure Being.3 Xenophanes, according to Theo­
phrnstus, was himself a disciple of Anaxinmnder, 4 and 
there is nothing against the theory that he w;i8 first in­
duced by that philosopher to study the nature and causes 
of the w01-1d. Jt is Lrue that he followed his predece~­
Hor only in regard to a few comparatively suboi:dinato 
points, whereas the maln tendency of his tlrnught pur­
sne<l another oonrse, and led to other results. Like 
Anaximander, he suppo~ed the earth and its inhabi­
tants to have originated frow the drying up of the 
primitive slime; 5 Anaximander held that the universe 
alternately sprang from the primilive matter, and

returned to it again, and Xenophanes taught the same 
in regard to the earth, which for him is the most im­
portant part of the universe. His opinion that the 
heavenly bodies are merely masses of vapour I reminds 
us of the earlier doctrine that their fires are nourished 
by the exhalations of the earth ; 2 and the infinite 
extension of the earth beneath, and the air above,3 
recalls the unlimitedncss of Anaximander's primitive 
matter. But the theories of Xenophanes about the 
universe generally are widely different from the system 
of Anax:imander. Anaximander makes, at any rate, an 
attempt to explain the formatiou and constitution of 
the universe in a physical manner, Of Xenophancs we 
are told nothing of the kind, and his conception of the 
stars ~hows clearly how little the naturalistic treatment 
of phenomena suited his mental tendency. He enquires, 
indeed, concerning the principle of things, but the 
enquiry immediately takes a. theological turn, leading 
him to test the current opinions concerning the beings 
in whom the ultimate cause is usually ~ought,-to the 
criticism of the belief in gods-and thus to the thought 
of the One eternal unchangeable Being who is not to 
be compared with any finite thiag. His philosophy is 
only naturalistic in regard to its point of departure ; 
iu its development it becomes a theological metaphy-

sic,1 But since the primitive essence is not apprehended 
in a pnrely metaphysical manner as Being without 
further specific determination, hut theologically as the 
Deity, or as the divine spirit ruling in tlie universe, 
Xenophanes is not obliged to dispute the :reality of the 
Many and the c1iangeable, or to declare the pheno­
menon to be rt deceptive appearance. He says, it is 
true, that every thing in its deepest principle is eternal 
and One, but he does not deny that, side by side with 
the Orn,, there exfot.s a plurality 0f derived and transitory 
things; and he passes over, apparently without observing 
it, the difficulty which, from his own point of view, is 
involved in this theory and the problem which it pro­
poses for enquiry. Parmenides was the first who recog-
' 'l'eichmiiller ( Stud. z. Grrsck. the very few physie,-.1 propo6itions 
d. Begr. 612) ia so far quito right that h,we come down to us. Even

d~~.1 It might ruore reason­
ably be asked whether Parmeuides really excluded from. 
his concept of Being all that from our point of view! 
seems to involve a plurality, and to transfer sensible\ 
c!ftcrminations to the immaterial essenc"c. This question 
we must amwer in the negative. Even if the compa­
rison of Being with a globe considered in itBelf, simply 
as a comparison, proves nothing, all that Parmcnides 
say~ of the limitednesf, homogeneousnees, and indi.visi-l 
bility of Being, 2 ~l@'II ~ Hui.t hs ,muceived it as. extevdc.d1 
in space, and never formed t,be ideD of a Deiug JJ:k 
·coiitainerl in space. For far from avoiding space­
cltltcrfiiii"nations as inadmissible, he expressly describe5 
Being as a fixul and homogencons mass, symmchically 
ext.ended from its cent.re on all sides-which within its 
limits ,Llways occupies one and the same place, nowhere 
interrupted by DOD.-Beiug, and at DO point contain­
ing more Being than at. another. \~ould be justi­
fied in rejecting thii; description as metaphorical o!rly', 
if we CDuld find any indication that Parmenides con­
c,d Beiuif-aa incorporeal, and if in other parts of bi~ 
philosophic discussion he made use of a figurative mode 
of expression ; bnt, neither is anywhere the case. More­

also attribute to Being magnitude in space, and the 
. .Atornists, clearly referring t') the doctrine of Par­
menides, identify Being with the body, and non-Being 
;witb empty ~ ; we can therefore scarcely be"'.sitate 
to ascribe to this philosopher the opinion which his

with his whole point of view; for e....u.nity of Beiug_.and

of his doctvine of Unity, is to_oJ~ali~tiqj,Q _b_e _ _p_o.s.si},ile, 
e~sitio~-that the i'm:p.QrulLand the 
incorporeal had not as yet been ;lfa.£.riminated. Ac­
~;;;i°ing to the excellent rewark of Aristotle,1 it is the 
substance cf the corporeal itself, not a substance dis­
tinct from the corporeal, with which he is concerned ; 
and when he says '0~ .Being is,' this signifies that 
we attain to the true view of things when we ab5tract 
from the separation and variableness of the sensible 
phenomenon, in order to maintain its simple, undivided 
and unchangeable substratum as the only Reality. This 
abstraction is no doubt a bold step; but in making it, 
Parroenides docs not so entirely depart from the whole 
prnvious tendency of philosophic enquiries as if he had 
started with a purely metaphysical concept, without 
ny regard to the data of the senses.

SENSE AND REASON. fi91 
So far, then, aB the knowledge of the Real is only 
po~sible by means of this abstraction, the abstract intel­
lectual study of things can alone lay claim to trnth: 
judgment belongs solely to rational speech (Ao~1os-)­
the senses, on the contrary, which reflect the show or 
appearance of plurality and mutability, of generation 
aud de5truction, are the cause of all error. -~ 
earnestly warns us therefore tD-tntBt, R,it the senses, / 
but reason alone; 1 and thus, like Heracleitn~~ive.i 
~ccasion to a diHcriminahon which in th~-~eque!__ was 
oJ!:----:Eiehighest importance, both for the tbeori..2_f kuow­
ledg·e a~enerally. In his own sys­
tefi'i;li"owever, it bas not ~ great importance ; it is 
there merely a comequence 'of the matei-ial and meta­
physical result~, not the foundation of tbe whole; the 
cognition of sense, and that of reason, are not opposed 
in respect of their formal characteristics, but solely in 
respect of their content; and the psychological investi­
gation of the faculty of knowing is so greatly neglected, 
as we shall presently see, that the philosopher ascribes 
to Thought the same migin as to l'erception, and 
derives both from the mixture of material substances. 
Although Parmenides so abruptly opposes reality 
to the phenomenon, intellectual thought to the decep­
tions of the senses, be cannot forbear pointing out, in 
the second part of his didactic poem, what thr:,ory of 
1 Parm. v. 33 sqq., 52 sqq. iv. 234, ~f. Ari~t. Gmi. et corr. i, 
(supa, p. 68+, l ), to which little is 8, 325 b, 13). Many sceptics 
added by late" Wl'itel'S ( e,,q. Diog. counted Parmenides as well as his

the world would result from the standpoint. of ordinary 
opinion, and how individual phenomena would in that 
case have to be explained.1 
The right view allows us to recognise in all things 
but One, Being; ordinary opinion adds to this, non­
Being.2 lt tbcrefiu:,& regards tbin~·s as 29mpounded of

variable as becoming and changeable. ]f we p1ace 
ourselves therefore at this point of view, we shall have 
to admit two cleweuts, of which one corresponds with 
Being, and the other with non-Being. Parmenides 
culls the former light or fire, and the latter night ; 
and in tbe fragments of his writings which we possess 
he describes the forwer as the rare, and the latter as 
the dense and t.he beavy.4 They arc also named, by 
other authoritiei, the warm and the cold, or fire and.

He may perhaps have attributed a vivifying and forma­
tive influence generally to warmth in the origination of 
organic beings, and in the formation of the universe ; 
but it is self-evident that he can ncitbel' have used 
these Aristotelian expressions, nor intended to explain 
movement universally, as Heracleitus did, from the 
warm element as such. For in that case it would have 
been unnecessary to a~mmc a particular mythical figure, 
by which a11 combination of substances is brought 
about1-the goddess who is enthroned in the centre of

of the light and the dark be represents iu a symbolic 
manner as a sexual union ; describing Eros as the first 
creation of the world-ruling goddess,! and these elements 
themselves as the masculine and feminine.2 He seems 
to have introduced other symbo1ic beings as gods,3 be­
sides Eros; but we are not told what part they played 
in the formation of the world. 
That Parmenides borrowed his doctrine of the two 
elements from an older physical theory is not probable; 
for in the first place we know of no theory which would 
have adapted itself to this purpose; 4 and, secondly, he 
'himself 8ays that the ordiI1ary opinion of mankind gene­
rally, is the object of his exposition in the second part 
of the poem. Accordingly, this exposition is founded 
on a fact which could not well esc:ipe observation, viz., 
that the sense perception and common opinion see in

-the parent of the gods and of all things ( vide supra)

to tbe central fire of the Pytbagomans, the mother of 
the gods and former of the world. 
Besides these cosmological notions, we have some 
anthropological theories handed down to us as those of 
Parmenides. He seems to have conceived tbe begin­
ning of the huwan race as a development from primitive 
slime, brought about by the heat of the sun ; 1 and his 
opinion on this subject bas therefore been identified 
with that of Empedoeles.2 What he says on the differ­

to us to learn that he derived the phenomena of the 
life of the soul, perception and reflection, from the 
mixture of substa.uces in the body. He supposed that 
each of the two primitive substances is sensible of that 
which is akin to it, and that therefore the notions and 
thoughts of men are of this or that nature, recollec­
tions remain or are lost, according as the warm or cold 
element predominates in the body: he sought the cause 
of life and of intelligence in the warm element; 1 but 
even where this is entirely absent, as in the corpse, 
there must still be sensation ; only that sensation is 
then to be referred, not to light and heat, but to the 
cold, dark element. 2 We see from t1:iis that even Par~

menides is still far from discriminating between the 
spiritual and the corporeal, and that he does not attempt 
to distinguish perception an<l. thought in regard to their 
origin and formal character, though he entirely recog­
nises the superiority of the rational assertion to the 
sensuous intuition ; for that such a view is only enun­
ciated in the second part of his poem is unimportant for 
this point. If he had been aware of the distinction, he

sics is a point on which opinions have been divided 
from the earliest tim.es.1 Some suppose that in them 
we have throughout only the standpoint of delusive 
opinion, and not the personal convictions of the pbilo­
soph-er. Others think that he did not intend to deny 
all truth to· the world of phenomena as such, bnt only 
to discriminate its divided and variable Being from the 
One and undivided Being of true exilltence. This second 
theory has had many advocates in modern times,2 but I 
cannot support it. Parmenides himself declares too ex­
plicitly that he acknowledges only the one unchangeable 
essence as a reality ; that he does not concede a particle 
of truth to the ordinary notion which shows us plurality 
and change; and that, consequently, in the second part 
of his poem he is stating the opinions of others~ and not 
his o_wn convietions.3 Aristotle apprehended his doctrine

in this same way; 1 Plato tells us~ that in contradict­
ing the ordinary view, Zeno was entirely at one with 
his master ; and it is entirely beyond question that 
Zeno absolutely denied plurality and change. It may 
seem strange, on this view of the matter, that Parme­
nides should not only give a detailed account of 
opinions wbich he considers altogether worthless, but 
should construct a specific t.heory from theii-point of 
view ; it may also seem unlikely that he should entirely 
deny the truth of the sense perception, and that in his 
few propositions concerning the One, which are rather 
negative than positive, he should believe himself to 
have exhausted the whole of the trutb.0 But what else 
could be said, ao.d how could he express himself dif­
ferently on the subject of reality, having once started 
from the proposition that only Being is, and that non­

PIIYSICS, 807 
he purposes not to overlook even hostile opiniuns.1 The 
reader is to have both theories set before him, the true 
and the false, in order that he may the more surely de­
cide for the true. The false theory of the universe is not 
indeed not represented as it is actua.lly fotmd with any 
of the previous philosophers, but as, according to the 
opinion of Parmenides, it ought to be expressed. This, 
however, we find in other ancient authors. Plato often 
corrects the opinions that he combats, both as to their 
content and the manner of apprehending them. Thn­
cydides does not put into the mouth of his characters 
what they really said, but what he would have Raid in 
their place. Parmcnides adopts the same dramatic 
procedure; he represents the ordinary view of the world 
as he himself would regard it if he placed himself on 
that standpoint, hut his design fo not to cxpouud his 
own opinions, but those of others; his whole physical 
theory has a merely hypothetical import. It is designed 
to show us how the world of phenomena would present 
itself to us if we could regard it as a reality. But it 
is clear from the exposition that the world of phe­
nomena ean only be explained on the theory of two 
primitive elements, one corresponding to Being, and 
the other to non-Being; and consequently, that it pre­
supposes at all points the Reing of non-Being. And 
therefore it is the more evident that the world of phe­
nomena itself, a~ distinct from the One and eternal 
Being, has no claim to Reality. Parmenides, however, 
did not attempt that thorough dialectical refutation of 
the ordinary mode of presentation, which, we are told

by the most trustworthy testimonies, was the special 
achievement of Zeno.1 When a dialectical procedure 
of this kind, therefore, is ascribed to Parmenides by 
later writers,2 t}iey are confusiug biw with Zeno: only 
the beginnings of such a method oan be reoognised in 
his argument against the Being of non-Being . 
. ZENO. 
PAmIENIDES had developed the Eleatic doctriIJe to a 
point beyond which it could not be materially carried. 
It only remained for his successors to defend his vie\VS as 
opposed to thtl ordinary presentation, and to establish 
them more precisely in their particular details. The 
more minutely, however, the relation of the two stand­
points was considered, the more distinctly must their 
entire incompatibility, and the inability of the Eleatic 
doctrine to explain phenomena, have appeared. On 
the other hand, where an underntnnding with ordinary 
opinion was attempted, the purity of the definitions 
concerning Being must have immediatflly suffered. To 
have seen this constitutes the merit of Zeno and 
2\'lelissus. For the rest, these two philosophers are 
agreed both with each other and with Parmenides. 
The only differenee between them is thu.t Z.eno, who

DIALECTIC. Gl3 
Zeno adopted for Lhjs purpose an imljrect method. 
Parmenides had derived his determinations of Being 
. directly from the concept of Rtiing. Zeno proves the 
same doctrine indirectly by showing that the opposite 
theories involve us in difficulties and contradictions, 
and that Being doeH not admit of our .regarding it 
as a Plurality, as something divisible and changeable. 
He seeks to prove the Eleatic doctrine by reducing the 
prevalent mode of presentation to ahsurdity.1 Because 
of t}1is method, which he employed with masterly ~kill, 
Zeno was ca1lcd by Aristotle the inventor of Dialectic/ 
and Plato says that he could make one anrl the same 
appear to liis hearers as like ;md unlike, as one and 
inauy, as in motion and at rest.3 Though this Dia.lectic' 
afterwards furnished many weapons to the Ed~tic of 
8qq. thinks it was ~hiefly dire~t<ld 
against iumxagoras and Lcuclppn~; 
~ut in the <lem,mstr;:.tions of Zc1m

the Sophists, it is itself distingufohcd from that Eristic 1 
by its positive object; and still less, for the same reason, 
can it he identified with Scepticisrn.2 The dialectic 
argument with Zeno, though it does not altogether dis­
dain Sophistic applications, fa never anything but a 
means to establish a metaphy~ic conviction, the doc­
trine of the unity aud invariability of Being. 
· --·-In particular, the argument.8 of Zeno, so far as we 
are acquainted with them, are concerned with multi­
plicity and motion. The arguments against the multi­
plicity of things which have been tranHmitted to us 
have respect to their magnitude, number, Being in 
space, and co-operation. The arguments against motion 
are likewise four, which Zeno did not arrange in the 
lm;t order, uor accordiug to irny fixed principle. 
I now proceed to examine these arguments collec­
tively:-

time infinitely 8IIiall and infinitely great. Jrofi-m,itely 
8mall; for as every plurality is a number of unities, but 
a true unity alone is indivisible-loo each of the )fany 
must either itself he an indivisible unity, or b,, made 
up of such unities. That which is indivisible, however, 
can have no magnitude; for all tliat has magnitude is 
infinitely divi3ible. The particular parts of whieh the

the assertion of GMgins: Niki/

many comists have consequently U!J magnitude. If 
they are added to anything it will not become greater, 
nor if they are taken away will it become less. But 
that which, being added to another, does not make it 
greater, and being taken away from another does not 
make it less, is nothing. The .i\Iany is therefore infinitely 
small ; for each of its constituent parts is so ~mall that 
it is nothing.1 On the ot.bcr himd, however, the$e part~

these parts : they also must liave a magnitnde, and be 
separated f'rom one another, and so on to infinity. 
Thus we get an infinite number of magnitudes, or an 
infinite rnagnitude.1 
2. By the same process, Zeno shows also that foe 
_'.\.fany in respect of number must be as much limited 
as unlimited. Limite.d, fo1· it is just. ~o much as it is ; 
not more and not less. Unlimited, for two things im: 
two, only where they are separated ; and in order that 
they may be sep>irate, somelliing must be between 
them ; similarly between this and each of the two, 
and rn on ml irifin'ii'wni. 2 As in the first argument, 
the determination of infinite magnitude, so here t.he 
determination of infinite number i3 attained by ap­
prehending plurality as a multiplicity of ~eparnte

unchangeableness of Being.t 
1. The first argument. is this :-Before the body 
that is moved can arrive at the goal, it must first have 
arrived at the middle of the coarse; before it reaches 
this point it must have arrived at the middle of the 
first half, and previously to tLat at the middle of the 
first quarter, and ~o ad infird,tnm. Every body, thera­
fore, in order to attain to one point from another, must 
paHs through infinitely many spaces. But the infinite 
cannot be passed throngh in a given time. It is con­
~eqnently im posHiblc to arrive at one point from another, 
and motion is impossibie.2

could never be overtaken by the swiftest, Achilles, 
if it had once made a step in advance of him. For 
in order to overtake the tortoise, Achi11os must first 
reach the point where the tortoise was when he started; 
next the point to which it had progressed in the 
interval, then the point which it attained while he 
made this second advanec, and so on ad irifinitwrn. 
But if it be impossible that the slower should be over­
taken by the swifter, it is, generally speaking, impos­
sible to reach a given end, and motion is impos:;ible.1 
The whole argument turns, as in the other case, upon 
the assertion that a given space cannot be traversed 
unles8 all its parts ,1re traversed; which is not possible, 
because there is an infinite number of these parts.2 The 
only difference is that this as:,;ertion is applied in t.he 
first case to a space with fixed boundaries, and in the 
second, to a space with movable boundaries. 
3. So long as anything remains in one and the 
same space, it is at rest.. But the flying arrow i8 at 
every moment in the same spai::e. It rests, therefore, 
at every moment of its flight : therefore its motion 
that we know of Parmenidos (r.f. 
the often quoted passage, Farm. 
128 A) proves that he did not ap-
11ly him&elf in this mann~r to the 
dialectical -,,efutation of the ordi·

argument, too, is based on the same process as the two 
previous arguments, In them, the space to be tra­

In the moment as such, no movement, no change 
generally speaking, i;; possible; if I ask where thr; 
flying arrow is at t,his moment, the answer cannot Le 
in the transition from the space A to tlie space n, or in 
other words, in A and B; the answer can only be in 
the Epace A. Consequently, if time is conceived as an 
infinite series of successive moments, instead of a fixed 
quantity, we necessal'ily get, instead of the transition 
from one space to another, merely a successive Being 
in separate spa1:es: and motion is ju8t as impossible a:,; 
if ( similarly to the iixst a11d sr,cond of Zeno's argu­
ments) we suppose, instead of the line to be traversed, 
an infinite number of successfre and :,epnrate points.1 
The argument before us is therefore not so sophistical 
,lS it appea.rs t.o be ; at any rate it is not more sophisti­
cal than the othera. It. starts, like them, from the per­
ception of a philosophic problem in whicb more recent 
thinkers have also found considerable difficulties; ancl it 
stands in the same cor.nections with Zeno's general point 
of view. Tf Cnity and Multiplicity be once regarded 
in the manner of llie Eleatics as absolute contradictories 
pmit-i vely e:x:clnding one another, separation in time 
and :;pace may easily be looked upon as a plurality 
devoid of unity; space and time as an aggregation of 
separate points of space and time, and a transition from 
one of these points to another,-a motion,-becomcB 
irnpossible.2

4. The fallaey in the fonrth demonstration is more 
apparent. This refers to the relation of the tiwe of 
movement to the space which has to be traversed. 
Accoruing to the laws of motion, spaces of equal size 
must 1Je traversed in equal time if the speed be equal. 
But two bodies of equal size move past one another 
twice as fast if they are both moving at equal speed, as 
if one of them is still, and the other with the same 
n10tion passes by it. Hence Zeno "'entures to conclude 
that in order to traverse the same space,-the sracc 
taken up by each of these bvo hodies,--at the same 
speed, only half the time is necess·ary in the one case 
that is necessary in the other. Consequently, he tbinks, 
facts here e011tradict the laws of motion.' 
which it is, is proved by the r,hser­
vation that it is in the same space

Df PORT OF HIS ARG UJIKVTS. 6:!b 
The falsity of this condusion strikes us at once; but 
we must nut therefore suppose that Zeuo was not per­
fectly in earnest regarding it. For the whole fallacy 
i!-l based upon th:i": that tbe space traversed by one 
body is measured according to the ~ize of the bodies 
which it passes, whether these be in motion or at rest. 
That this is not allowable might well, hQweYer, Ct:,<::ape 
the notice of the first philosopher who studied the laws 
of motion g·enerally ; especially if, like Zeno 1 he were 
convinced, to start with, that }1is enqniry would re:mlt 
in conlradictions. Similar paralogisms have b,,en over­
looked even by modern philosophers in their polemic 
ag,Linst empirical concept.ions. 
Tbis i~ not the place to criticise the scientific value 
of Zr.no's dcrnonstrntions, the cen~ures of Aristotle in 
regard to them~ or the ju<lgments passed by the 
modern:; 1 on both. ·whatever tbe absolute worth of 
these arguments may be, their hi~torical irnportaoce 
is~ in any case!, not to be underrated. On the one hand, 
another. Cl will arri\'e at Al 
and B! at the same moment that 
Bl has arPimtl at A4 and C./ (vide 
figure :l). n1 has, therefore, p"-Ssed 
all the Cs, ,end Cl all the Bs in 
the same ticne tilat each of r.hem 
passed the half of tJ-,e As. Or, as 
Zeno SP.fms to ha1"e e:Ipres~ed it, 
Cl has passed all the Bs in the 
sa.me time, in which B l has passed 
half of the As; and TI l has passed 
i.11 the08 in the sametim~ in which 
Cl has passed half of the As. Illlt 
the row A. t"'kes up th~ ~"me s P"-"e 
as each of the other t.wo rows. 
The time in which Cl ha~ pas~ed

the opposition of the Eleatic doctrine to the ordinar.y 
point of view attains in them its climax; multiplicity 
and change are not opposed by Zeno as Ly Parmenides 
with general arguments which might be met by other 
general propositions; their imposaibility is proved by 
these notions themselves ; and thus any impression 
which might still be left by tbe exposition of r~arme­
nides that side by Hfrle wit,h the One Being the many 
and the variable may still somehow find place, is en­
tirely done away.1 On the other hand, however, pro-

hlems were thus proposed to philosophy in regard to the 
explanation of phenomeoa, the consideration of which 
it has never since been ablo to evade. The apparent 
insolubility of these problems afforded welcome support 
to the Sophists in their denial of knowledge; but they 
afterwards ga\'e a la-sting impulse to the most search. 
ing enquiries of Plato and Aristotle, and even modern 
metaphysics has constantly been forced to return again 
and again to the question,; first brought under discussion 
by Zeno. However unsatisfactory for us may be t.ho 
immediate result of his Dialectic> it has therefore been 
of the highest imporfance to science. 
V MELJSSUS. 
MELISSUS resembles Zeno in his attempt to defend 
the doctrine of Parrnenides ag·ainst ordinary opinion. 
\Vhile, however, Zeno had. sought to effect this in­
directly by the refutation of the usual theorieB, and had 
thus strained to the utmost the opposition of the two 
points of view, 1'rlelissus 1 seeks to show in a direct

over has mist1nderstood the pre.

!\dmitted the pre-supposition of 
p!n=lity without unity, not in his 
O'Wn name, but me:rely from bis 
aJxersaries' standpoint. This is 
in a c""rtain sense f,rue. He desires 
to r~fuu, his adversaries by draw­
i11g contradict-0ry inference~ from 
their presuppositions. Bat thn 
middle tenns, which he employs 
for this pUl'Pase, belong not to 
them, but to himself. Their con­
tet1tion is merely: there is a 
plurality-a motion; h~ seeks to 
provo th,tt the Many, the Many 
being assumed, must con~ist of

BEING. 629' 
All that has been transmitted to us of Melissus' 
doctrine of Being may be reduced to the four deter­
minations of its eternity, its infinity, its unity, and its 
invariability. 
That which is, is u:iderived and imperishaUe. For, 
were it derived, it must have come either from Being 
or from non-Being. Now that which arises from Being 
is not derived, but has existed previously; and from 
non-Being nothing can be derived ; least of all Being 
in the absolute sense.1 Similarly, if it passed away, 
it must be resolved either into something existent or 
something non-existent; but Being cannot become non­
existcnt, ;:i.s all admit; and if it passed over into a 
lleing, it could not be :-11.id to perish.2 
If Being is eternal, it must also, Melissus thinks,

1s evident that it approved itself to Aristotle neither 
in itself nor in regard to the arguments on which it i,, 
based. In these, the confusion between infinity in tiwe, 
and infinity in space, is apparent. Melissns bas proved 
thu.t Being must be according to time without b0gin­
ning or end; and he concludes from thence, that it can 
have no limits in space. Tl1at this is the sense he gives 
to the infinit.y of Being them can be no doubt.1 He 
~upporfa his statement, howerer, by the further observa­
tion that Being can only be limited by tbe \'oid, and 
as there :is no Yoid, it must be unlimited. 2 But jf 
the limited extension which Parmenides attributes to 
Being was hanl to reconcile with its indi v foibility, thi~ 
unlimited exteusion is much harder. Although, tlicre­
forr, .M:elissus expressly guards liimself against 1,he 
corporeality of Bci11g,3 yet the observatioll of Aristotle ·1 
that he seems to conceive it as material, is not alto­
gether unjust. \Ve mayrn.ther suppose that the Ionian 
physies, in spite of his hostility to them, had had some 
influence on 1\lelissus, and had givr:n rise to this theory

of the uDity of Being. 
It is true that our philosopher directly infers the 
unity of Being from its unlimitedness. If the1·e were 
several Beings, be says, they would necessftrily all ho 
limited in regard to each othm·; if Being is unlimited, 
it i,; also one.1 In hi~ opinion multiplicity al"o is in 
itself inconceivable. For in order to be many, tl1ings 
must be separated by the void ; but there cannot be a 
void, for the· void would be nothing else than nou­
Being. Even :if we supp(ise that the parts of matter 
directly touch one another, without having anything 
between them, the argument gains n[)thing. For if 
matter were dividcrl at all points and there were con­
sequently no unity, there could aho be no multiplicity~ 
all would be empty space; if, on the other hand, matter 
were only divided at ce,tain points, there is no reason 
why it should not eycrywhere be so. It cannot, there­
fore, be divided at all.2 Finally, ::'1'1elissns also attains

Being cannot mo,'c, it can experience no increase, 
no change of its condition, no pain ; for every move­

the arising of something new. Rut Being is One, and 
there is none beside~ ; it is eternal, RO that it m,ither 
ceases nor anses; it is nccc~sarily, therefore, changeless, 
and always like itself; for all change, even the slowest,

likely that t}1e Atomist.s horrowed this, their funda~ 
mental theory, from Mclissrn; (vide infra). On the 
other hand, tlie remark about rarefaction and conden­
sation points to the school of Anaximenes. From this 
it. is dear that, Mcli~Ru~ occupied himself to a consider­
able extent with the doct.r:ines of the physicists. 
On the whole, with the exception of the statement 
tbat the One is unlimited., we -find that our philosopher 
adhered strictly to the doctrine of Parmenides. This 
doctrine, however, was not deve,loped further by him, 
and though he unrlertook to defend it against the 
physicists, his arguments are unmistakeably inferior to 
those of Zeno in acuteness. Hut they are not wholly 
valueless; his ohservat.ions especially concerning motion 
and change give evidence of thought, and bring out 
real difficulties. Besides Pu.rmenides and Zeno, he, 
appears only a;, a philosopher of the second rank, but 
still, considering· his da.te, as a meritorious thinker. 
It is obvious that he afao agreed with the above-

· Some of the ancients ascribe to Jielissus physical 
propo;;itions. According to Philoponu~, he first, like 
Parmenides, treated of the right view, or the unity 
of all Being ; t1ien of the notions of mankind, and in 
his third section he named fire and water .as the primi~ 
ti ve substances. 2 Stoureus ascribes to him, iu common 
with Zeno, the Empedoclean doctrine of the four ele­
ments and of the two moving forces ; and that in a 
sense which at 011ce 1mggcsts a later origin.3 Stobams 
also says that 11e maintained the All to be unlimited, 
and the world to be limited.4 Epiphmiius represents 
him as having taught that, nothing :is of a permanent 
nature, but all is transient.~ These statements, how­
ever, inc exceedingly suspicious; first because .Aristotle 
expressly mentions as characteristic, of Parmenides, in 
contradistinction from Xe110phanes and Mclissus, that 
side by side with Being he enquired into the cames of 
phenomena; 6 and secondly, because they arc indivi-
