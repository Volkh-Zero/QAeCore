Exactly ‚Äî for your personal/global VS‚ÄØCode settings,
C:\Users\kayno\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json is the right place to drop those tweaks.
Here‚Äôs how it works in practice:

üìÅ Where settings.json lives
- Global/user scope ‚Üí
C:\Users\kayno\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
Changes here apply to every project and workspace you open.
- Per‚Äëworkspace/project scope ‚Üí
Inside the .vscode folder of that project:
<your-project>\.vscode\settings.json


- These will override your global settings only for that folder.
If you want your VS‚ÄØCode to always load with more aggressive CPU/memory/env settings for everything (parsers, Python workers, Qdrant uploads, etc.), put those JSON entries in the user settings file you mentioned.‚úèÔ∏è How to edit it cleanly- In VS Code, press Ctrl+Shift+P, type Preferences: Open Settings (JSON).
- That opens the exact file at
C:\Users\kayno\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
(no need to browse to it manually).
- Paste in your tuning keys, e.g.:
{
  "terminal.integrated.env.windows": {
    "UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE": "32",
    "PYTHONUTF8": "1"
  },
  "files.watcherExclude": {
    "**/node_modules/**": true,
    "**/dist/**": true
  },
  "python.analysis.indexing": true,
  "python.analysis.memory.keepLibraryAst": true
}


- Save ‚Äî VS‚ÄØCode applies most of these immediately.
üí° Tip for Python‚Äëexclusive workflows:
Some speedups for your stack will live in the Python extension settings or in your tool configs (pyproject.toml, .env, etc.), not just VS‚ÄØCode‚Äôs JSON. For example:- Increase python.analysis.memory.keepLibraryAst to keep parsed libs in memory.
- Use "python.linting.enabled": false if your workflow runs lint in CI, freeing resources locally.
- Point python.defaultInterpreterPath directly at your tuned venv to avoid re‚Äëresolving.
If you want, I can bundle you a Python‚Äëonly, high‚Äëthroughput settings.json profile that focuses on maxing CPU and I/O for parsing and embedding pipelines, so your 13700K actually breaks a sweat. Would you like me to draft that next?
